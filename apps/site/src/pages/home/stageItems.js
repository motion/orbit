  <Bubble two>you're just not using it right</Bubble>,

    email, tickets, the wiki, all the different rooms here...

    <Bubble>this shows good potential</Bubble>
    <Bubble two>the icon isn‚Äôt good that you have now</Bubble>
    <Bubble two>
      and i think with some tweaking this could work as a logo concept -
      animation proves some extensibility too
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble three>
      yeah, new idea is really close though to being what I think you would need
      to start shopping the concept around
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble four>we actually have this indicator</Bubble>
    <Bubble two>
      that is prototype stage but meant to signify you have something relevant
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble>
      signifies that its a small thing that sort of hangs around with you
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble two>the little line is nice actually</Bubble>
    <Bubble four>makes the logo 10x more identifiable</Bubble>
    <Bubble two>with some tweak maybe</Bubble>
    <Bubble>Lorem maybe rounded to the O</Bubble>
    <Bubble two>
      I think screens will really help. Going to try and add by tn
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble four>
      but thinking about ‚Ä¶ that idea ‚Ä¶. of, the answer to the ‚Äòso what‚Ä¶‚Äô
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble two>
      ‚ÄúThe one dashboard that Sauron would‚Äôve made if he was a good guy.‚Äù
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble two>I need to get the screenshots in there</Bubble>
    <Bubble three>
      maybe oil slick concept goes more like this for that first problem
      statement part
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble four>
      also think that ‚Äúunifying force for your team‚Äù may be too long
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble three>
      may want to do some simple moire or comic dot-grid effects that sort of
      procedurally space-fill the empty areas with black/white checkers/dots
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble two>
      using ben-day dot pattern for the transition between the different
      sections could be a cool way to carry motif through it as well

      mockups for graphite drawings I‚Äôm having produced in China
