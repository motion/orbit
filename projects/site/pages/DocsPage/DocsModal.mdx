A `<Modal />` is useful for displaying content above other items. Modals extend `<Section />`, so
they accept a number of useful properties for displaying them, like title, subTitle, icon,
collapsable, and more.

To use a Modal:

```tsx
import { Modal } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples

Modal is currently in beta. It works just fine, but is fairly simple. Feel free to use it and submit
feedback for us on use cases you'd appreciate.
