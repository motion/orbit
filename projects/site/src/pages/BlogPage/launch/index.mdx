It's been over 4 years since our team first raised money. While there are many stories I could tell,
I want to focus on one general topic as we head into private beta: how my thinking has changed the
most in our various struggles and successes.

I'd say that is **we have no good system for building truly ambitious companies, and nearly every
startup is being funded and coerced into building iterative, marginal ideas which amounts to a
tremendous waste of our collective potential**.

There are huge problems all around us, ones that don't necessarily need huge funding, but more need
long timelines and small or medium sized group of talented people to be able to work on them without
disruption.

I'm really grateful to our investors at Founders Fund, because they are the only ones I know of who
at least somewhat tackle this problem. They do it by being focused exclusively on "moonshot" ideas,
by being completely hands-off with the founders, and with being more willing than most to fund risky
ideas. We need more of that.

Before I get into anything, I think it's most useful to see the dramatic evolution of Orbit over the
last half decade. It both helps you understand where we are today, but also just shows what can
happen if you're allowed to really push on ideas and not be afraid to take dramatic turns, late in
the development process.

This is only possible if we have investors who truly do "invest in the people", who are willing to
take long term risk, and who are willing to put up a good amount of money without demanding constant
reporting, checkins, and pressure to perform at constant meetings.

## The evolution of Orbit

### Dev tools

A dev-focused startup creating a Meteor-like platform on React with a dramatically simpler syntax,
focused heavily on DX. If the video wasn't worth watching I wouldn't embed it here, but we really
did push this far and I'm proud of the work.

All of the above was _really working_ (with a lot of babel compile-time magic to get variables to be
reactive, plus static style extraction), but we ended up not releasing it for a variety of reasons
I'd be happy to detail in another post.

2. What could be described as "Uber for internal data science", started as a service that would ETL
   data sources into a graph and APIs, where we then had built an interface to put together
   interactive, explorable data-visualizations very easily for contractors we'd hire to plug into.
3. With the second idea successfully deployed at a few companies, feedabck from one of our bigger
   clients was that a single use case within it: t-SNE, a high-dimensional and unsupervised
   clustering algorithm, especially the ease of iteration, visualization, and then further analysis
   of clusters, would be dramatically helpful. Our novel improvement was to take the current-best
   Barnes-Hut approximation t-SNE algorithm and approximate it with neural net to enable basically
   instant (linear-time) clustering.
4. After which we ran into a variety of problems, one a founders health, another with an employee,
   and finally a realization that perhaps tackling many problems at once that were either outside
   our expertise or interest at once wasn't the "right" way to go about it. We decided to hit reset.
   We wanted to make the app work a bit more towards the consumer, a bit more on problems we
   understood.
5. After much research, introspection, and discussion, and reviewing our past work, we felt that the
   general area of "why is knowledge at work siloed, cluttered, stale, and left in noisy places". We
   embarked again two and half years ago on this, and it went as follows:

This blog post will cover the following:

### The problem

First, it's nearly impossible to deliver a multi-platform app that doesn't feel terrible. Second,
our apps lack the ability to collaborate, share data, and generally are stuck in an old
"one-app-world" mentality. And finally, it's just way too damn complex at every level.

Orbit Center solves a problem our team has been been thinking and working on for years. And
importantly, .

We aim to make it far easier to build commons apps. To do that, Orbit comes with an incredibly rich
toolkit and development environment. For the first time you can just download an app and begin
building production-grade apps without touching the command line.

## The always-on HUD for your day

A nice way to think of Orbit is as an on-device heads up display. It's a lot like Spotlight, if you
could build apps on top it and launch them to your desktop.

Orbit apps have a few principles that make them fun and easy to use.

### Keep it light

Every Orbit app should have a single purpose, and show only a single main screen with an optional
list next to it.

### Always searchable

Orbit has an always-on searchbar for everything. And with a single property you any table or list in
Orbit becomes searchable.

### Wildly open

Orbit apps work together. That's not marketing speak, it's the most key concept behind the platform.
Every app can have any of the following abilities:

- Sync - import data into a common format, called a Bit.
- Display - it's own content, embedded into any other app.
- API - expose a Typescript API to any other app.
- Graph can expose a GraphQL API to any other app.

This makes for a perfect "workspace" for your team to collaborate on apps together. It also unlocks
huge abilities that our platforms just don't attempt, as their apps are completely closed.

A great example is the Slack app. The Slack app uses all four abilities: Sync, Graph, Display, and
API. That means once you import the Slack API

### Default private

Orbit apps run entirely offline, locally on your device. Thats right: you can firewall the upload on
the Orbit app and nothing will leave your computer. We think this is so important - how can you
build a unified data platformw wihtout trust and control? That answer is, you can't.
