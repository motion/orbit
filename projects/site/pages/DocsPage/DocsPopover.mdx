A `<Popover />` is very flexible and handles many use cases for showing items as menus or dropdown
from other items. Some of the abilities popovers have:

- Automatically handles edges nicely, including adjust the pointing arrow it uses.
- Attaching automatically to a component through `target`, or manually with `top` and `left`.
- Opening on hover, click, or both with `openOnHover`, `openOnClick`.
- Preventing hover on children for tooltip-style popovers, using `noHoverOnChildren`.
- Closing on click or click away with `closeOnClick` and `closeOnClickAway`.
- Grouping with other popovers so they are never open at the same time with `group`.
- Controlling the amount of hidden but hoverable padding with `forgiveness`.
- Controlling the `distance` from the target.
- Showing with a background `overlay` above content.
- Controlling the Surface it uses for children, `sizeRadius`, `elevation` etc.
- Controlling the arrow with `arrowSize` or `noArrow`.

For an example of a Popover in action, you can check out `<Tooltip />` which uses a few properties
to turn popovers into effective tooltips.

To use a Popover:

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples

Popover is currently in Beta. While it handles many very complex use cases, it breaks in other
simple ones. A truly effective popover is a really hard problem, and we've spent years refining on
various use cases, but in the course of time other ones have broken. Currently showing a popover
"above" content breaks fairly consistently. You'd think that would work. But at the same time, far
more complex cases like handling mouse movement with various edge padding across multiple elements
works ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. We're planning on revisiting this very soon and fixing many bugs.

### Base

We'll be this popover for the rest of the docs, referred to as `<BasicPopover />`. Popovers are
fairly low level, so re-using them is common.
