Please do your best to verify that all items are in the order before leaving the restaurant, and handle all food with care. If you or a diner discover a missing or damaged item upon delivery, please direct them to our support center, which they can reach through the Caviar app, website, or by responding to their order confirmation email. For a quick response, please text Courier Support to handle your issue. We will refund or replace the items as appropriate.`
