# Unsilo (Cloud Lock-In)

- looking around at the cloud theres a hell of a lot of silos
- gsuite cloud search
- only works for google services
- ms365
- only works for microsoft
- Dropbox, Jira, etc
- Our knowledge is locked into platforms
- But they don't operate in the same platforms, ideally
- slack
- confluence, intercom, etc
- how to solve lock in?
- a company dedicated to unifying cloud services.
- its _sole mission_ must be to unify the cloud
- but it has to do it without breaking permission, security.

Orbit does that.

# A Decentralized Intranet

- intranets solve the same problems: curation, news, search, profiles
- but they dont work how we work now: across many services
- they are always out of date, because they dont use our sources of truth
- install is a huge pain:
  - on-prem is laborious and expensive
  - cloud is insecure and creates permissions hell
- on device is the answer:
  - completely secure
  - install can be instant and painless
- p2p can sync any metadata for curation
- aggregation is the new curation
- machine intelligence for smart answers, summaries and more
- eventually deploy apps internally with ease
- Orbit

# The Stunning Lack of Ambition of OS X Mojave

- We were promised Software 2.0
- iOS gets: Notification noise reduction
  - where is that on OS X?
- Dark theme is the big feature
- Why does spotlight not search your cloud services?
- Does anyone use Notification center on Mac?
- This looks like a Step release
- WAIT
- Apple focusing on performance is important and good
- but it leaves room for companies doing intelligent software
- and especially for work related tooling
- desktop software doesnt work with us

# Knowledge Management is Broken

- Confluence, MediaWiki -- Slow, Stale, Cumbersome
- Notion and other newcomers -- Just copying the old players with a slightly better interface
- Knowledge still has big problems:
  - It's hidden
  - It goes stale
  - It doesn't source Slack, Github, etc
  - It requires active searching
  - It sacrifices privacy or requires a huge install
- We're building orbit to fix all of that, [here's how it does it[(#10).

# Anti-Cloud, and Revolutionizing Knowledge Management

- On desktop: at hand, upgrading Spotlight
- Stale: Unifying sources, topic based grouping, cosal
- Passive search, not always active
- Aggregation of knowledge: Experts, Projects
- Private, no install

# Why MVPs no Longer Work for Most Things

- very Thiel article
- hard things become more important
- You can still fake the general pitch
- but as software 2.0 becomes more prevalent the quality of the product bar goes higher
- machine learning becomes more used
- interfaces are becoming more complex and require more thought
- problem sets have to integrate lots of data, bigger data, more disparate
- saturation for typical products is so high
  - can you imagine another trello coming into pm tools now?
- now startups must tackle big problems

# The Great Cloud Blind Spot

- on how SaaS has become over-done, and desktop software is now under-valued
- patio11 wrote an article about why desktop wasn't as good (for bingo creator)
- but his article is unpersuasive:
  - mac app store has improved and is improving more and more
  - now has easier payment story
  - so his 2x conversion is likely not as relevant
  - also some apps are great for web, but some arent
- the desktop has some big advantages:
  - better user experience
  - can be always on
  - easier to integrate with notifications
  - better shortcuts, cross-app communication
  - more power with files
  - more stickiness long term
  - easier multiprocess
  - can use python, go, rust, swift as needed

# The Tension between Vision and Research

- pitching something requires showing the "dream"
  - crafting a reality people want and resonate with
  - "resonation" is a super-dimensional thing
  - its hitting a dream state that is strongly desired for many reasons
- meanwhile doing market research is dividing a space
  - want to really slice which pieces you want best
- these are essentially polar opposites
- painting vs checkboxes
- some things work well as checkboxes:
  - dropbox
  - airbnb
- some things are horrible as checkboxes, but great paintings:
  - high ux: webos / ios
  - multi-featured: slack / airtable
- painting-like ideas are harder to validate
- they are also harder to execute
  - getting just a few pieces wrong can ruin a painting
- but they are also likely undervalued/underexplored
- and its a lost value in modern society due to MVP-culture
  - requires leonardo da vinci / steve jobs "many-talented execution"

# Privacy and design are your most important features

- Look at Mozilla's latest experiment (Recommendations with Laserlike)
- Look at previous cloud search companies
- Look at ugly chrome extensions with no keyboard navigation
- People forget that privacy is not just a feature, but one of the biggest features
  - It forces you to sell your product at a price which garners trust
  - It gives people the chance to try your product without compromising their data
  - It lets you do a ton more because you can now access a lot more of their data without issue
  - It reduces your liabilities and overhead of safeguarding data
  - It makes your users love you rather than hate you
- Design is the other most under-considered feature
  - Your product is almost worthless without great design, even if it's revolutionary
  - Design is not just gradients, it's speed, interaction, and all the small details
  - Good design can take 75% of your product's development time (it's harder than you think)
  - It makes people love your product and spread it organically (See Framer X)

# the motivational theory of software development

- you need big goalposts that are spaced out "just enough"
- you'll always have one big one in every project, "cut first beta release"
- you can count on demoralization if you don't hit a goalpost every 1-2months
- they don't need to be "big" just need to be concrete, measureable
- but also they should have some "demo" (showoff-driven-development)
- the downside of thinking this way is it can encourage feature bloat
- be sure goalposts look like this pattern:
- [hacked together/runs] => [big features] => [big refinements] => [release]

(Launch Post:)

# A commitment to control

- a new generation of products
- user-first as a feature
- decentralized (peter thiel reference?)
- completely private data - a first
- extensible and hackable
- release significant portion of base open source
- build value based on design, low level features, market
- survive due to get stewardship not lockdown
- the value of being user-aligned > the value of tracking data
- companies that do this will out-compete companies that don't
- software is getting mature enough to allow this to be a feature

# Smallthoughts and Showoffs: How to build a antifragile company

- Smallthoughts and Showoffs, or Incoming and Outgoing
- Incoming: observations from the real-world, showerthoughts
- Outgoing: a channel to showoff your recent work, technical or not
- Why they matter:
- Incoming:
  - Nintendo got into video games because Gunpei Yokoi was observing someone passively hitting buttons on a calculator for amusement
  - He had a small thought: people like to play on small devices with screens
  - That small thought led to about 200+B in revenue and ongoing
  - Make a room in slack #smallthoughts
- Outgoing:
  - You're always achieving small milestones
  - It feels great to hit them, but often there's no place to release that
  - Humility is good, but you need an outlet for celebration
  - We created a #showoff room 3 years ago and it's been our "most successful" idea
  - It has many great downstream effects:
    - A small place to celebrate small and big wins
    - Lets you define your own wins: getting a technical bug is a great showoff
    - That helps the company calibrate what matters internally and builds pride
    - Is asynchronous so you can celerate as you feel the need without disrupting
    - Forces you to make things presentable and encourages doing nice screen recordings
    - Sense of unity and achievement
- Why it makes you antifragile:
  - Small thoughts bring in fresh content without "needing to be a big idea"
  - Showoff is similarly an unencumbered way to measure what people care about and keep them happy
