  ## Our Mirror app lets you view your designs on a mobile device in real-time

  To preview your designs on your mobile device download the Figma Mirror app for iOS or Android here.

  When your computer and mobile device are connected to the same WiFi, select a frame in your design on Figma.com (or in the desktop app), you will see that reflected on your phone.

  Please keep in mind that Mirror doesn't scale content. It's a 1:1 mapping to what you see in the Figma Editor on your computer.

  Currently, Figma's Mirror App only supports Android 7 and higher. Since there are many Android users who use older devices with older versions of the OS, we would like to be able to support those in the future.

  Android users with older OS versions can still do the following.

  Go to https://www.figma.com/mirror with Chrome for Android
  Tap the menu icon (3 vertical dots in the upper right) and choose Add to Home screen
  Both Android and iOS users can also preview designs on the web. You'll want to have two (2) windows of Figma open. In one window, click on the frame you'd like to show. In the other, go to "https://www.figma.com/mobile-app" to see the design reflected there.

  You could then use the Shift + Command + F  shortcut (on macOS) to use the full screen mode.

  This can be a nice way to present your designs.

  NOTE. Prototyping is currently not supported in the Mirror App, this means tapping on hotspots will not work and you'll have to manually select frames from your computer.
