          <SubText>
            We were inspired by tooling that high tech companies use to unify
            their cloud tools and knowledge. Companies like Stripe & Facebook
            build tools that improve their internal visibility with easy search
            and feeds for any team.

          <Text>Our goal: to democratize that & make it best in class.</Text>

              Let's face it: you don't want to trust a company with all your
