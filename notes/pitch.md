Need to redo how it's pitched. Instead of some appeal to silos or history of ERP/distributed teams, or any of that, pitch it as the next version of Mac/iOS.

It's actually the platform that could unify them and be iOS X2 / Mac X2.

How?

It's the new homescreen of iOS, and the new launch menu for Mac X2.
