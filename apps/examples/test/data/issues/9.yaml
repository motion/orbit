title: Multiplayer user list, new visual indicator
author: Nick Cammarata
integration: github
type: issue
text: Currently we have a standard list for seeing who’s in the same workplace. However, this might be a fun area to innovate creatively on. Maybe we could have a neat graphic that animates based on the last person that entered. I don’t have any particular beliefs at the moment, but rather a general intuition that there’s something here!
