We're building essentially an "autonomous" Stripe Home as a Service. Desktop app with no cloud component so its secure and with a no-commitment trial.

It's company news, search, visibility into people, teams, and projects. By pinning important documents to a teams, so you can throw out an always-stale wiki. Eventually grows to power your org-chart, and is something everyone is using all day every day to see whats going on.

Solves problems of intra-company visiblity, knowledge management, duplicate work, finding experts, and running remote distributed teams.

## The features, as of now

* Home: relevant convos and company news you missed (unify your co, reduce incoming overload)
* Explore: automatic org chart, beautiful/smart status cards for teams + projects
* Knowledge: the non-wiki
  * just use docs/tickets/slack as noraml, then pin the important things to your team feed
* Search: unified cloud search

Think of it as Intranet 2.0, with no infrastructure.

We're about a year into development and have a lot done. The frame is in place and a lot of the initial features are working. We can use it day-to-day.

Now it's just "fit the market". We need to features to be better and more useful. But we can't just "guess" so we need to find "sweetheart" company that wants a great solution like this and is willing to trade getting early access and grandfathered in for free, in exchange for letting us work at their office to roll it out with their teams.
