<IntroText>
  Orbit includes everything in the application, from development environment to app store to sync
  system.
</IntroText>

If you have downloaded the Orbit.app and have set up your workspace, you can create a new app using
the interface. If you are so inclined, you may also use the CLI instructions found below.

## Using the Interface

You can edit apps through the GUI by hitting the `Edit` option in the menu of any app. You can also
just work on it through the command line.

You can run `orbit dev` inside any app folder to edit it. As a helper, you can type
`orbit dev [package-name]` to edit any app within your current workspace.

Publishing is as simple as pushing to your git repo. Other members of your workspace will be
prompted to update the app with a notification that shows the message you include in your commit
message.

## Using the CLI

The Orbit CLI is used to develop and eventually deploy apps with Orbit. The apps can run in a couple
ways:

1. Individually on their own, in their own window.
2. Together in a workspace.

### Orbit App Format

Orbit app is a git repository (it's recommended to name it with `-orbit` suffix) which adheres to a
set of conventions:

1. It is a valid npm package (has `package.json` file with valid npm metadata).
2. Its `package.json` has `"orbit"` section which has the following format:

- `"id"` optional, lets you reserve a name in orbit app registry
- `"title"` specifies application title
- `"require"` specifies runtime requirements for the app, the following is optional:
  - `"orbit"` specifies the version of Orbit runtime required for this app (`1` is the only valid
    option for now)

The example `package.json` for an app could look like:

```
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "orbit": {
    "id": "my-app",
    "title": "My App",
    "require": {
      "orbit": 1
    }
  }
}
```

### Installing Orbit Runtime

For now, the orbit cli lives in app/orbit-cli as @o/orbit-cli. Eventually it will be bundled
together with the app-kit under one name, the npm package `orbit`.

Orbit runtime is distributed through npm:

    % npm install --global orbit

After it's installed the `orbit` command is available on `$PATH`, try it with:

    % orbit --version

### Running an Orbit App

You can start an app with the following invocation:

    % orbit run GIT_REPO_URL[#REFSPEC]

Where:

- `GIT_REPO_URL` is an URL to a git repository with the app source code, this can be a local git
  repository.
- `REFSPEC` is an optional part which specifies git reference to use (commit, branch, tag), it's
  default to `master` if not specified.

Orbit will checkout the app's source code into a cache, install all dependencies and start an
application window and configured processes.

Note that `orbit run` won't install the app - all app's data can be removed any time. If you want to
continue using the app - you should install it, either using `"Install App"` button or using
`orbit install` command.

### Installing an Orbit App

You can start an install an app with following invocation:

    % orbit install [OPTIONS] GIT_REPO_URL[#REFSPEC]

This will install it into your current workspace, which if you are working with a team will install
it for your entire team to use.

By default, Orbit creates your apps inside `~/orbit-[workspacename]/[package-name]`. Where
package-name is the unique name in the package.json. You can configure this location in the orbit
configuration, at `~/.orbit.json`.

### Listing Orbit Apps

List installed orbit apps:

    % orbit ls

List all orbit apps available (this will lists also apps which were run but not installed, can be
used to install apps which you want to continue to use):

    % orbit ls --all

### Searching for apps

Orbit hosts an app store that helps you find new apps. To search them just use:

    % orbit search [query]

That will return a list of apps that you can install by their unique github repo. Apps that are
published in the main orbit repo will reserve their package.json name for easier usage. So you can
install search and install:

```
% orbit search slack

  - slack  (https://github.com/orbit/slack)

% orbit install slack
% orbit run slack

```
