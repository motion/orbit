I'm excited to be introducing Orbit into private beta today, after a long development period.

Orbit is a platform for building apps, starting with a focus on apps that work together as internal
tools for teams. Our goals are to make development as fun and easy as possible while not sacrificing
real power. Part of being fun is that you need to include everything you'd want in the box, and
that's what Orbit aims to do, and part of why it's taken so long to get here.

We'd love it if you [sign up to the insider list](#end), we'll only update on development progress
and invite you to early access.

## What it is

I like to think of Orbit as a heads up display for your computer. It's like Spotlight, if Spotlight
had an app store and applications you could build, and if the data sources you plugged into it were
accessible across applications.

Orbit has a few principles that make it really fun.

### Keep it light

Every Orbit app should have a single purpose, and show only a single main screen with an optional
list next to it.

### Everything searchable

Orbit has an always-on searchbar for everything. And with a single property you any table or list in
Orbit becomes searchable.

### Wildly open

Orbit apps work together. That's not marketing speak, it's the most key concept behind the platform.
Every app can have any of the following abilities:

- Sync - import data into a common format, called a Bit.
- Display - it's own content, embedded into any other app.
- API - expose a Typescript API to any other app.
- Graph can expose a GraphQL API to any other app.

This makes for a perfect "workspace" for your team to collaborate on apps together. It also unlocks
huge abilities that our platforms just don't attempt, as their apps are completely closed.

A great example is the Slack app. The Slack app uses all four abilities: Sync, Graph, Display, and
API. That means once you import the Slack API

### Secure first

Orbit apps run entirely offline, locally on your device. Thats right: you can firewall the upload on
the Orbit app and nothing will leave your computer. We think this is so important - how can you
build a unified data platformw wihtout trust and control? That answer is, you can't.

## A brief history

Orbit didn't start as an internal tools platform, and in the future it wants to expand to be a
platform for anyone -- the most fun way to build real-world applications for any platform. If you
want to understand better some of what Orbit is doing, read on. If you just want to know more on the
_how_, skip ahead to the next section.

## A look forward
