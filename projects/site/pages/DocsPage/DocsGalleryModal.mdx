A `<GalleryModal />` is similar to a `<Modal />`, but designed to show a list of media. Modals
extend `<Section />`, so they accept a number of useful properties for displaying them, like title,
subTitle, icon, collapsable, and more.

To use a GalleryModal:

```tsx
import { GalleryModal } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples

GalleryModal is currently in beta. It works just fine, but is fairly simple. Feel free to use it and
submit feedback for us on use cases you'd appreciate.
