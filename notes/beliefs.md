## updates to beliefs

After talking to daniel (YC/Greplin) and stuart and charlie (Workday):

- Just search is good if done uniquely well
  - Peeks being good and very fast more important
  - Highlights within the list results more important
  - General smoothness of app more important
  - Use context to power the home page
    - Recent things youve talked about
    - Recent conversations
    - Recent things youve looked at
    - Use all that to power the home relevancy search
- Focus on knowledge internally not personal (Confluence > Gmail)
  - Crawler more important
  - Adding multiple integrations necessary
- Need to have at least a story for cross platform/mobile
  - React native mobile
  - Need to figure out good strategy for mobile
- Need to have good story for larger companies
  - May need to see about doing some cloud stuff

Talked to Rahul (Uber), Jeff (Deloitte), Ariel (Hulu):

- They have issues with internal search
- They built their own custom intranet systems (DeloitteNet)
- Rahul thinks Docs especially seeing updates is the hardest
  - he consistently has to keep 10 tabs open to track docs
- Rahul also thinks after that hooking into APIs would be best
  - this is actually a huge advantage for Orbit, building a custom API search integration doesn't seem easy with a big cloud or on prem service, even if only for feedback loop of development. Plus firewall issues.
  - We can basically let them query whatever endpoint they want and return it in a format we set up to help us rank.
- Jeff and Ariel both hate the intranets but didn't get too much more from them, it's perhaps a minor positive that they seem pretty interested overall.

# Jul 6th

Talked to James (Juul):

- Profiles are really big especially for onboarding
- Showing recent collaborations
- Making it easy to explore whats going on with people
- Not much slack search important for them
- Our platform play is very much closer to windows/ios than to slack
  - Slack integrations have no access to _other_ data within a company
  - Slack integrations have no security
  - Slack integrations can't really query internal database/apis
  - Slack integrations can't have any custom interface
