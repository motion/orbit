Use `<TimeAgo />` to output nicely formatted dates that are shown relative to today. TimeAgo will
update the display as time passes to be in sync.

TimeAgo will attempt to display the date in as short as possible syntax, as it's often useful in
areas of the interface where space is precious.

To use TimeAgo:

```tsx
import { TimeAgo } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples

<Example chromeless id="Basic" />
