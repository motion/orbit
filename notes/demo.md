# Orbit - Augmented OS

Our digital lives are in need of an upgrade. And the only way to do it is to break out of the box. Today, everything we do lives in two boxes:

- Your content lives in many boxes, in the hands of many SaaS companies
- Your browser and OS keeps every app within their own box, never able to interact

Orbit breaks both of those boxes at once, giving a Augmented OS platform for your digital life. We're calling it Orbit OS.

To begin, we've built three beautiful apps that show the power of an augmented operating system. It took a lot of engineering and thinkign outside the box to achieve it. And we have some incredible next steps beyond these apps.

Today, we're introducing People, Topics, and Memory.

## People

Orbit syncs your entire cloud for the first time completely privately down to your computer. From your mail to your conversations, documents to the websites you browse. Orbit can sync it all, and it does it all in a totally unique way: completely private to your device.

The first app we've built shows the power of this by bringing the people you interact with every day across your entire cloud, right into a beautiful and incredible Contacts app that as always by your side.

The People app is always on, and understands what you're looking at: whether it's Chrome, or any other browser. Whether you're chatting in Slack or using your favorite custom Mail app. The power of Orbit's Context Engine means by simply holding the Option key and pressing "1", you can see relevant people to what you're doing now within a second.

Since every Orbit app is insanely fast and completely keyboard-controllable, you can quickly move through and see all the people related to what you're doing, and the topics they care about through the Orbit AI Engine.

## Topics

You and the people you interact with on a daily basis are constantly communicating. It creates noise and can be incredibly distracting. You want to focus on what you're working on, but still keep up to date with whats going on.

The second app Orbit is launching with is Topics. It lives in your tray and is always aware of what you're working on. By holding Option you can see related topics to your current work and what you've been talking about recently. Then a few taps of the down arrow let you move between those topics and get an idea of any interesting or important items in your cloud.

It's a new way to stay in sync without the chaotic overhead and stress of an ever-preset chat room, allowing you to focus on deep work while still staying in the loop.

## Memory

Memory is the final app in Orbit, and the one that is most exciting. It's your digital brain, a list of things you've been active on recently that you can manage or let Orbit manage for you.

Because the Context Engine is always privately understanding what you look at and work on, and the Language Engine understands topics and groups, we generate lists that are useful to you and relevant to what you're doing now.

## Search

Finally, Orbit gives your Spotlight an upgrade with amazingly fast search across your entire cloud. It uses on-device topic modeling and an incredible amount of work into performance and interface to allow you to quickly search, browse and understand your cloud knowledge base.

## Orbit

We're incredibly excited to be launching Orbit. It's been the result of years of research and development and many many iterations in order to be sure we implemented features that are useful, novel, and helpful. Early versions of Orbit were clunky, and it took us many iterations to get all the pieces in place. But our beta tests have gotten exciting in recent months. The apps work, and we have high engagement across them all.

Our mission is to bring our operating systems into the new world. To let us build apps that leverage the amazing powers of new advances in machine learning, while resolving the tensions between the many silos we operate in all at once.
