  ## Automatically adjusting the width and/or height of text objects

  As you edit text, you may want the width and height to automatically adjust or stay put depending on the situation. To set the auto-resizing behavior, use the Advanced Type panel where you can select:

  Width. The width and height automatically adjusts to fit all content.
  Height. The height automatically adjusts to fit all content. Lines are wrapped to fit within the width.
  Fixed. The width and height stay put. Lines are wrapped, but overflowing lines are currently not clipped.
  Note that manually resizing a text object set to the Width or Height auto resize mode will switch it to Fixed.
