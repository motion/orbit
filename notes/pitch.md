# Orbit

There are a lot of productivity tools, especially for managing your team or personal knowledge.

The companies that make them come and go. More often than not, they get acquired or shut down and your years-long investment into them is completely lost.

Orbit wants to re-negotiate our relationship with apps.

What if you could try a new notes app, and if you don't like it, switch right back to your old one?

Orbit is a productivity platform. It the best building blocks in the world for building apps. It has a model that de-couples the data from the app and lets apps use the power of SQL with simple reactive queries.

It has an app and component store for building and trying out amazing apps. And you can build new apps inside Orbit itself, with no extra tooling required.

Think of it as a new app platform for your computer.

Using Orbit's incredible UI Kit and reactivity, you get much faster and more efficient apps that feel better than native.

Orbit itself just focuses on providing helpful syncers for your various data types, a beautiful, powerful and easy to extend platform that feels better than native, and smart APIs that power the apps.

We've built some amazing abilities into every app already:

- Natural Language Analysis
- Topic Modeling
- Inline Augmented Highlights
- Unified Profiles

But most importantly, Orbit gets the model right from the start. We believe the future of apps will be selling intelligent upgrades that augment your current data.

But you should always control the data, and be able to move it wherever you'd like.

- You get complete privacy guaranteed (and provable)
- You have fine-grained permissions control over which apps see which data
- There's never lock in, you can move your data around with ease
- You can extend your data with new apps, without worry

## Technology

in sum: we have a shitload and its really well positioned.

- doing it on-device requires a lot of work, from syncing efficiently to storing carefully to indexing, to doing performant on-device NLP and search. we've solved all of this
- the interface has massive room to grow and all the tech is working to power that already. this includes much much more intuitive and quick movement, multi apps, augmenting your operating system with windows, showing marks on your screen, etc
- the stack itself is also far beyond anyone near us. its a massive monorepo where we control just about every piece and they all work together extremely closely and well. it was a risk to invest in it but the risk is now paying back. we built much of it during the three years previous doing multiple startups: we have incredibly great syntax and abstractions for logic and views together as well as libraries from top to bottom from intense popovers, lists, panes, selections, filtering, etc which is really important for making it all flow. not just that but impressive HMR and intense REPL scripting for amazing development speed
- generally the entire UI kit is massive and fleshed out, far more than it should be as a relic of past startups and my life history. we have extreme ability to move quickly, from virtual lists to very intricate and keyboard navigable popovers to table views, lists, segmented controls, etc. even mature ui kits at the big companies lack many features we have
- and the important thing is we control it top to bottom and develop every piece of it in unison on our device with no complex infrastrucure. we've really overindexed for developer speed, and still have a lot of juice we can squeeze here.

## Interface

It's hard to overemphasize the difficulty and importance of interface. We spent a ton of time getting this right (think: almost a year of intense experimentation and prototyping). We had to redo it completely at least 4 times. We built up a huge colleciton of quality components and abstractions to make it possible. We're deep into refining it so it feels amazing. This is not easy stuff, and no one is even close, and it's so important.

## Featureset

It's both a lack of features, the interface for them, the way the are implemented, and the depth of polish. We are working on the last piece, but the features we've landed on are hard earned and valuable. Now we just need to make them work fluidly. We have quite a few things I think that are so different from what everyone else is even thinking of that makes all the difference:

- Easily switch between spaces
- Unified profiles of people in your space
- A ton of iteration into search / NLP

##

## Direction

- App store and becoming the next Mac / iOS platform for simple apps

## Wow

- OCR and augmented computing

## Brand

Need to redo how it's pitched. Instead of some appeal to silos or history of ERP/distributed teams, or any of that, pitch it as the next version of Mac/iOS.

It's actually the platform that could unify them and be iOS X2 / Mac X2.

How?

It's the new homescreen of iOS, and the new launch menu for Mac X2.
