title: Mobile viewer loading performance
author: Nick Cammarata
integration: github
type: issue
text: Itâ€™s really important that loading speed is fast on mobile, because downloading heavy files over 4g can take a long time. Perhaps the best way is to store a compression version of the file ahead of time, so that it can be downloaded more quickly.
