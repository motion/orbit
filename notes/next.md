Next:

Search/filtering refactor:

- overmind
- generic filters for every app
- redo queryfilter/search filter stuff
- support: in:github label:x, etc

Next:

- research using google drive + slack as a file store then we can be all local.
- create new app pane (cnap)
- cnap - permission on who can see it
- can we store auth stuff inside the auth integration itself?
- otherwise we can have our cloud by default
- Use firebase
- but let them deploy their own on prem if they ask
- and just built the docker on prem stuff once they ask for that
- create new app from search
- custom app development stuff
- look at fb flipper. Building their own development tools may be interesting. Like a special debugger or something.
