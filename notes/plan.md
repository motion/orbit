# Product strategy

  - ? add crawler
  - ? add custom API
  - ? add maybe salesforce

  - needs performance and visual work
  - keyboard movement needs to scroll up/down
- Improve Peek and OrbitCard for various integrations
  - they all need quite a bit of work data/design wise
  - showing updates from recent activity
- Profiles
  - need to first have them aggregating
  - then need to design out profile cards
  - need to figure out featureset too for expert topics
- Bugfixing
  - all over
  - handle desktop changes
- Productionizing
  - smooth build to prod process
  - auto updates in app
- Onboarding
  - need better story for setting up and sharing integrations
- Website
  - signup process
- Setting up your team
  - Once you download app you can set up and invite people
  - Shows a modal saying "hey this will sync some basic stuff, not private data"
  - How does it handle integrations for various people
