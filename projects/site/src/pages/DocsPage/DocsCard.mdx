A `<Card />` combines a `<SizedSurface />` with a `<ListItem />` as it's header. It's
`<Collapsable />` as well.

To use a Card:

```tsx
import { Card } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples

### Props, Sizing, and Theme

<Example id="Basic" />

### Collapsable

<Example id="Collapsable" />

## `<FloatingCard />` <small>(BETA)</small>

A `<FloatingCard />` allows you to place a card somewhere floating in the interface.

<Example id="Floating" />
