It's about time! I'm really excited to start talking about Orbit. It's certainly been an intense few years of development, and it feels really great to reach the point where I can start to speak more about it.

I'll start with the most exciting part. We have [our first alpha build]() ready to download. Give it a try. While some of the most interesting parts are barely working, we have pushed hard to get it to where everything we want to do over the next year is roughly in place, auto updates, and looks and feels close to what we want.

So, what is Orbit?

Let's start with the mission:

> To take back the web as we know it now by giving end-users decentralized control over their data and interface for that data.

To achieve that, we describe Orbit as:

> An upgrade for your Operating System that integrates all your interesting information into a searchable, explorable, extensible, and (most importantly) beautiful and smart platform.

I like to think of it a merger of the worlds of _Browser_ and _Operating System_. We used to exclusively edit _Files_, now we work mostly in the _Cloud_.

Where browsers don't deliver on their promise is where operating systems get it right: Fast, unified, searchable, extensible, and privacy-controlled. In the cloud your data is siloed, remote, uncontrolled, slower, and distributed across N incoherent interfaces.

We want you to have a beautiful experience for managing all your knowledge in one place, letting you extend and control it. Orbit is re-thinking the Operating System in the world of today: where a "Bit" of information replaces yesterdays "File" (Get it? Or*bit*).

#### How we got here

About two years ago we pivoted. We had wasted too much time chasing problems that weren't in our expertise. We wanted to build something that solved real problems for a more consumer/end-user demographic.

So in the proceeding months we hypothesized, interviewed, debated, prototyped, and eventually landed on the following problems:

1. Day-to-day information is getting more noisy, disparate, and hard to explore/find.
2. Intranet systems and Wiki's go stale / require too much upkeep to stay relevant.
3. It's hard to understand who is good at what within companies.
4. Internal apps are a pain: from build to deploying to maintenace.

#### How we save the internet

In fact one of the coolest things I can imagine Orbit ending up is by releasing a home server that manages all your personal data privately. I'm calling dibs on the name Ora for that, by the way.
