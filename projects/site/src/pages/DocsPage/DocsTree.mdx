A `<Tree />` is a virtualized treeview, built to handle hundreds of thousands of elements,
and with selection, expansion, and keyboard movement built in.

Trees use a denormalized object to render, so you'll need to convert any array into an object
before your use a tree.

To use a Tree:

```tsx
import { Tree } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples

### Basics

Lists are simple to use. The items are dynamically sized, and most of the elements like icon, title, subtitle, and children accept any `ReactNode` you'd prefer. You can add extra elements
using `before` and `after`.
