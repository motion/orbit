We're running into a problem. We're losing control, and we're losing information. Well, not all of us. Companies in the cloud are gaining a lot of control. Some teams have found temporary balance, perhaps in an ERP of old or new.

But on the whole, good tools are becoming less good because for us in aggregate, because many greedy actors will never reach an optimal equilibria.

And it's pushing us further and further into a pit.

The pit looks something like this:

- The Cloud is easier to build for and faster to iterate on.
- It gives us superpowers that our Operaing Systems lacked:
  - Links between things
  - Easy to embed media
  - Easy to embed scripts from other apps
- It also gives companies complete control over your data.
  - Companies like this.
- But, The Cloud fails at almost everything else that our OS'es (should have / used to) be good at:
  - Your data lives in a complete black box for each app
  - With N interfaces for N apps
  - And N searchbars for N apps
  - And N logins for N apps
  - And often N^2 tabs for N apps
  - With almost 0 shared libraries between N apps

And it's killing our productivity and ability to run our companies. And this isn't hyperbole. The Web as it is today is missing some big pieces. It doesn't give us the primitives we need.

But we don't have to look far to see examples of what it could be. Take BeOS. Or WebOS.
