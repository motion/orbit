A `<Button />` is a simple extension of a Surface, as you can see from it's source code at the bottom of the page. To learn about all the props Surfaces accept, check out the `<Surface />` docs.

To use a Button:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples

### Basics

<Example examples={Ex} source={ExSource} id="Basic" />

### Alternates

See `Alternates` for a full list of alternate states, how you can define them in themes, as well as element which accept them.

<Example examples={Ex} source={ExSource} id="Alternates" />

### Sizing (Preset)

See our `Sizing` page to read more on the pre-defined size props and which elements accept them.

<Example examples={Ex} source={ExSource} id="Sizing" />

### Grouping

Using either a `<Row />` or `<Col />` with the group prop allows for grouping, which will join together inner elements and properly handle removing the border radius in the intermediary elements. You may also group items using `<SegmentedRow />` to avoid wrapping them in an element.

<Example examples={Ex} source={ExSource} id="Group" />

### Elevation + Sizing (Absolute)

Elevation is a standardized shadow amount on any button. Shown here, it scales well with size.

<Example examples={Ex} source={ExSource} id="Elevation" />

### Passing Multiple Props

Using `<SurfacePassProps />` you are able to attach props to the next level of surfaces.
While typically it's recommended to use inheritance and create your own custom Button component,
this adds more flexibility.

<Example examples={Ex} source={ExSource} id="PassMultipleProps" />

### Sizing Props

Because Button extends `<SizedSurface />`, you get complete control over
it's various sizable properties.

<Example examples={Ex} source={ExSource} id="SizingProps" />
