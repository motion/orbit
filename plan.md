our goals

* broadly
  * significantly reduce workplace stress
  * increase ability to focus / deep work
  * make internal company ops 10x clearer
* narrowly
  * fix notification overload (noise to signal)
  * stop missing out on conversations/topics (unknown unknowns)
  * make personal search great (tame the cloud)
  * reduce intranet need + make wiki/knowledge more useful (wiki is dead, long live wiki)
  * completely replace intranet systems: (intranet 2.0)
    * "who is this?"
    * "whats the latest on?"
    * "whats important about?"
* personally
  * make a statement on how to make software
  * show that the world lacks great products
  * deliver on software 2.0 promise
  * give people the feeling of power over their cpu

our general strategy

* replace your spotlight/notification drawer with a smart intranet work-focused app

our unique product strategies

* desktop app = far more powerful, present minute to minute (super high engagement)
* attach to any window = contextually relevant, smarter, engagement
* no cloud = can aggressively soak in all their integrations (more value)
* no cloud = enables extreme cross integration features (calendar x docs x hr x ...)
* nlp = able to answer harder questions and do more useful summaries
* nlp = able to tackle bigger problem areas with less tools and time
* ocr = able to work with any app you use + makes a badass demo

our unique go to market strategies

* no cloud = privacy / aligment with end users = user confidence (no one but apple does)
* high user alignment + beautiful product = super high potential end user brand dedication
* invest more into branding = more ability to work with people during beta for launch
* free personal app = easy to get high user count initially
  * because of this makes sense generally to have:
    * longer beta
    * give to big names for launch
    * invest more in nice branding
    * have better design
    * have more thought through, broad features
* very unique technology, go-to-market, and product means lots of juice for PR/articles:
  * want to spend more time in beta and pre-write a lot of topics covering various areas with high chance of spreading virally / appearing on HN homepage
  * tech articles alone could have an article every other week on HN for first few months
  * unique desktop/privacy/notification stress/deep work ... memes have high kinetic energy
* include a few but very high audience influencers in our beta, potentially even as investors
  * people like patrick collison, john gruber, various high influence programmers, etc
  * anyone who promoted superhuman, meteor, + influential in design community (khoi vinh etc)

our keys to success

* making the summary really work well
* befriending our integration companies
* working a long beta with influential people
* ensuring the PR around user-alignment catches
  * we need to be seen as "the apple of startup" in terms of user-alignment
  * this requires us to have clear direct-from-user/company monetization plan from start

features

* news
  * gets us into users hands directly
  * very strong for marketing
  * simple summary of globally interesting things + personally interesting things
* search
  * justifies us to take over cmd+space and spotlight
  * gives us high engagement and gets users used to using us
* explore
  * it's what we can sell to _companies_ because it gives them control
    * they can curate their home sections
    * they get value from a nice org chart
  * its the area that can grow most in terms of price-point value
* context "one more thing"
  * helps justify the big ask of taking over their various shortcuts and onboard time
  * amazing for demo / brand
  * gives us novelty factor which increases virality big time
  * actually has huge business case once it works well
    * dont forget how awesome it would feel to have an agent looking out for you

risks

* setup time with integrations will take a while
  * onboard focus and demo impressiveness should help
