## beta

* refresh token
* gmail sync
* slack sync
  * grouping messages into logical chunks

notification reduction ideas

* general mantra here:

  * you'd need to be able to trust the app is doing a good job showing you everything / handling everything so you could turn off some other apps for good parts of the day. so i'm not against basically exploring a lot of ideas and "over-doing it" in terms of features for our own tests. we could later cut out ones that dont work, but the feeling of cohesion is a strong thing to meditate on how it could affect your day to day & what you'd need to feel comfortable doing that.

* quiet mode

  * instant toggle
  * replies direct messages in slack with:
    * "im currently working on X, but planning on being back!"
      * could even roughly show what branch / app
      * can ask to leave me a message, shows in tray
  * effects:
    * this one is cool because giving you control
    * new way to compute: absolute control of notiications
    * could interact with mac to turn off mac notifications

* snap selections

  * super fast mark as read/archive
    * aim for a snapchat like reduction in steps:
      * click to select
      * click + move down to select multiple
      * bottom tray slides up "mark read | mark read + archive"
    * group into "project"
      * search "pundle"
      * select a few things
      * "make project"
      * share with team
        * side effects: helps sharing / spreading orbit
        * moves towards wiki style stuff
  * effects:
    * cool because we could uniquely focus on quickness
    * brings people into the app a lot more
  * risks:
    * encourages too much interaction / adds noise

* snap reply

  * just for email/slack (conversational things)
  * super quick (snapchat like reduction in friction)
  * purposely extremely simple, just text
  * effects:
    * if done right, no need to context switch to talk
  * risks:
    * complexity of app

ideas

* hover word/sentence while option holding to search
* select text to search
* simple contact cards / profiles
* projects
* drag from orbit to other app (share files to slack)
* pin peek in place so it doesnt hide when you leave
* quick create:
  * just type out some thoughts
  * can later easily turn it into any platform:
    * doc, email, note, chat

peek

* email sidebar shows main content
  * peek lets you scroll through thread
