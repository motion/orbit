**For Pickup Orders** 

Pay no order minimums, Service Fee or Delivery Fee when you order for pickup! Just place your order for pickup and go grab your food when itâ€™s ready at the restaurant.

**For Delivery Orders**

**Delivery Fee**

DeliverX has a delivery fee for each order. This fee varies across restaurants based on travel time from the restaurant and other costs associated with each restaurant partner. From time to time, we offer $0 Delivery Fees to highlight select restaurant partners. 

**Service Fee**

A Service Fee of 18% is applied to each DeliverX delivery order.

DeliverX relies on revenue from fees to help us pay our courier partners, provide quality customer support and logistics, process payments, and pay for other costs associated with providing our service. 

**Order Minimums**

Delivery orders generally require a minimum subtotal. During periods of unusually high demand, we may temporarily increase our minimum subtotal in some areas. Typically, the minimum will return to normal in 10 to 30 minutes.

**Restaurant Fees**

In addition, some restaurant partners may include fees on each order from their restaurant. These fees may include restaurant staff fees, bag fees, and related restaurant fees, as well as fees designated by their local or state authorities.`
