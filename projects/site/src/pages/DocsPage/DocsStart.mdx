  Welcome to the Orbit user manual. This documentation is designed to help you get building with
  Orbit even if you aren't a programmer. But if you are a programmer, that's alright, we'll all

Getting started with Orbit is simple and doesn't require setting up any development environment.
Orbit comes with everything you need.

You may be wondering right about now, what the hell is Orbit, anyway? It sounds like a lot of
trumped up hype to me.
