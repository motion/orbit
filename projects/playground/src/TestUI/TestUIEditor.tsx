The heart of Outline is the document editor. We let you write in the way that you prefer – be it Markdown, WYSIWYG, or taking advantage of the many keyboard shortcuts.

## Markdown

If you’re comfortable writing markdown then all of the usual shortcuts are supported, for example type **bold** and hit \`space\` to instantly create bold text. If you forget some syntax or are after a refresher, simply type \`?\` to access the keyboard shortcut help.

_Tip:_ You can even paste markdown from elsewhere directly into a document.

## Blocks

The editor supports a variety of content blocks including images, tables, lists, quotes, and more. You can also drag and drop images to include them in your document or paste a link to embed content from one of the many supported [integrations](/integrations)

_Tip:_ Headings are collapsible, just click the arrow to the left of any heading to temporarily hide the content below.
