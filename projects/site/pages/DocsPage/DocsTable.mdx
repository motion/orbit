<IntroText>
  A good table view is hard to find. Orbit makes powerful tables easy. Beyond performance, Orbit
  automatically guesses columns and data types. Virtualization and native-style multi-selection and
  movement come free.
</IntroText>

A `<Table />` is the highest level table view in the interface kit, though you can access lower
level ones if desired. It is virtualized by default, but acts almost entirely like a non-virtualized
table. It has many features built-in, including:

- Sorting, filtering, searching, and grouping through `useFilter()` props
- Selections and multi-selections through `useSelection()` props
- Display with titles, padding, elevation and more through `<Section />` props
- Sharing to the [Share menu]() through `shareable` prop.
- Keyboard navigation through the `Shortcut` store.

To use a Table:

```tsx
import { Table } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples

### Basics

Due to virtualization, tables can render many elements without breaking a sweat. Here, we're
rendering 10,000, but tables can go much higher.

Tables will automatically handle arrays, finding the columns and using them as titles. Here, we're
filtering down the columns a little bit for readability.

You can click on the table headers to sort, and drag on their edges to resize.

<Example willScroll id="simple" />

### Searchable

Adding a searchbox to a table is as easy as a single property, `searchable`. Searchable for now just
adds a plain `<SearchInput />` above the table.

<Example willScroll id="searching" name="Searching" />

### Customizing Columns

Controlling the order and various properties of the columns, including if they are resizable, the
value they use for sorting, their default width, and what happens when they change is all possible.
This is all managed through the `DataColumn` type:

`TODO: <PropTable name="DataColumn" />`

<Example willScroll id="columns" name="Custom Username Column" />

### Selections

Using the `selectable` prop you can turn on single or multiple selections. Click and hold to "drag"
your selection.

Multiple selections are powerful, and add the following shortcuts and useful ways to select:

- Hold <Key>⌘</Key> to select more than one.
- Hold <Key>shift</Key> to select a range.
- Unselect by holding <Key>⌘</Key> and clicking a previously selected item.

<Example willScroll id="selections" name="Multiple Select" />

### Filters

Table filters are very flexible. You can filter as many columns as you like, and do inclusive or
exclusive filters. See `TableFilter` for more information on the options they accept.

<Example willScroll id="filters" name="Filtering" />

### Using as a Section

Orbit aims to make building apps easy, so many of the high level views are wrapped in a
`<Section />`. Table is no exception. This lets you quickly and easily show a table, elevate it, add
a title and subtitle, and make it collapsable.

<Example willScroll id="section" name="Using as Section" />

### Scaling

As with anything in the Orbit UI, you can scale Tables as you need.

<Example willScroll id="scale" name="Scaling" />
