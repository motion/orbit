* context = knowledge company sales
* no cloud = privacy risk removed
* no cloud = earyl stage startup derisl, we can do all your cross integration features (calendar x docs x hr x ..., established companies wont)
* nlp = ai sell for desktop

## go to market strategy

* b2b first, medium sized SV companies first privately
* build it out as their dream intranet with a few contracts
  * ~100k/year with 10 companies
* 6 months later begin for launch of b2c version

  * hype in a The Grid fashion
  * brand as a big upgrade (Company OS + AI for OS)

* virality
  * funding one blog post a month that should go viral focusing on Deep Work, Software 2.0, Why Privacy, p2p apps, etc
  * free version should have great file finding / sharing features

## keys to success

* finding best initial companies to trial it with
  * have similar integration needs + will pay
* getting the product to actually work well
* having a properly impressive launch for b2c

## risks

* finding initial focus and go to market

* scaling up for bigger companies
