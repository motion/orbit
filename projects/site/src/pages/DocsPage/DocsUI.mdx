## Orbit User Interface

<IntroText>
  The user interface for Orbit has a few goals. It wants to feel native; in effect, to handle the
  various keyboard and mouse interactions you'd expect while having strong performance. It's other
  primary goal is to provide everything you need.

One great way to start understanding the UI kit is to see what is provided at the root of your
views. This is essentially gives you a roadmap to the internal functionality of the kit.

```
export const ProvideUI = (props: ProvideUIProps) => {
  return (
    <ProvideHighlight>
      <ThemeProvide activeTheme={props.activeTheme} themes={props.themes}>
        <ProvideDraggable>
          <ProvideSearch query="">
            <ProvideVisibility visible={true}>
              <ProvideFocus focused={true}>
                <ProvideShortcut>
                  <ProvideFocusManager>
                    <ProvideShare>{props.children}</ProvideShare>
                  </ProvideFocusManager>
                </ProvideShortcut>
              </ProvideFocus>
            </ProvideVisibility>
          </ProvideSearch>
        </ProvideDraggable>
      </ThemeProvide>
    </ProvideHighlight>
  )
}
```

As you can see, the UI kit has a variety of "modules", from highlighting text to drag and drop,
handling focus and visibility as well as shortcuts, shared data and themes.

Another good way to familiarize yourself is through the base level views that build upwards into the
higher level ones. To get familiar with layouts and the fundamental views, check out the docs on the
