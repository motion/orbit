import { DocsIconSearch } from './DocsIcon'

An `<Icon />` uses the [Blueprint icons](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/#icons) by default because
they cover a wide variety of tool-style app use cases, and are rendered to SVG which gives a lot of
control over how they look.

To use an Icon:

```tsx
import { Icon } from '@o/ui'
```

## Icon Search

<DocsIconSearch />

## Examples

### Basics
