<IntroText>
  Orbit includes everything in the application, from development environment to app store to sync
  system.
</IntroText>

With that said, the first step is to:

<Space size="xl" />
<Button size="xl" coat="purple">Download Orbit</Button>
<Space size="xl" />
<Divider />
<Space />

Once you've started Orbit, you'll be prompted to do three things for onboarding:

1. Set up your user account
2. Set up a workspace
3. Add apps into your workspace

### Onboarding

#### Do I need an account?

Orbit doesn't require an account to function. Accounts are only used to store a very limited set of
information, which will make it easier if you delete your Orbit.app or want to set it up on another
computer.

Orbit accounts only store a list of workspaces you are a member of, and some settings data about the
app itself.

They don't store any private keys or passwords to your workspaces. That feature will be released
later once we finish some of the optional cloud features.
