## secret

on-device/no-cloud

means three big things:

1.  10x faster development (and 10x simpler deploy/infra, and 0 cost of infra)

* its actually great in two ways:
  * it requires a bigger initial investment, which we've had: 3yr flint/devtools
  * once invested, it pays back much more: point were at now

2.  100x easier install process (literally download app and done, no on-prem, no signup)
3.  Perfect data security - 100x easier pitch to individual employees

## product x market strategy

* Nows the time for on-device intelligence
* on-device means you can avoid complex installs
* desktop agent hasnt been done yet, 1st to market

* high user alignment
  * this means our customers are direct end users
  * make them love it, and companies will pay for it
  * personal version is how we get people on board
  * company features make more money, so how to retain high user alignment?

## go to market strategy

* b2b first, medium sized SV companies first privately
* first build it out to be intranet + customer success tool
  * ~100k/year with 10 companies
* 6 months later begin for launch of b2c version

  * hype in a The Grid fashion
  * brand as a big upgrade (Company OS + AI for OS)

* virality
  * viral launch essential
  * funding one blog post a month that should go viral focusing on Deep Work, Software 2.0, Why Privacy, p2p apps, etc
  * free version should have great file finding / sharing features

## keys to success

* finding best initial companies to trial it with
  * have similar integration needs + will pay
* getting the product to actually work well
* having a properly impressive launch for b2c

## risks

* finding initial focus and go to market
* constraint fitting problems to solve early
* scaling up for bigger companies
