A `<Table />` is the highest level and most powerful table view in the interface kit.
It is virtualized by default, but acts almost entirely like a non-virtualized table.
It has many features built-in, including:

- Sorting, filtering, searching, and grouping through `useFilter()` props
- Selections and multi-selections through `useSelection()` props
- Display with titles, padding, elevation and more through `<Section />` props
- Sharing to the [Share menu]() through `shareable` prop.
- Keyboard navigation through the `Shortcut` store.

## Examples

### Basics

Due to virtualization, tables can render many elements without breaking a sweat. Here, we're rendering
10,000, but tables can go much higher.

Tables will automatically handle arrays, finding the columns and using them as titles. Here, we're filtering down the
columns a little bit for readability.

You can click on the table headers to sort, and drag on their edges to resize.

<Example id="Simple" />

Controlling the order and various properties of the columns, including if they are resizable, the value they use for sorting, their default width, and what happens when they change is all possible.
This is all managed through the `DataColumn` type:

`TODO: <PropTable name="DataColumn" />`

<Example id="Columns" name="Custom Username Column" />
