# Kit Internal

This is the private pieces of kit we don't want to expose to end users.

Mostly so we don't overload them with types and autocomplete.

Stuff related to managing apps and so on.

Because we keep our apps inside `@o/apps` so we can use our own kit and other utilities, we put things in here instead of in `orbit-app` itself.
