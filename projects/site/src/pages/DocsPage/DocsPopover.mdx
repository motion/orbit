A `<Popover />` is very flexible and handles many use cases for showing items as menus or dropdown
from other items. Some of the abilities popovers have:

- Automatically handles edges nicely, including adjust the pointing arrow it uses.
- Attaching automatically to a component through `target`, or manually with `top` and `left`.
- Opening on hover, click, or both with `openOnHover`, `openOnClick`.
- Preventing hover on children for tooltip-style popovers, using `noHoverOnChildren`.
- Closing on click or click away with `closeOnClick` and `closeOnClickAway`.
- Grouping with other popovers so they are never open at the same time with `group`.
- Controlling the amount of hidden but hoverable padding with `forgiveness`.
- Controlling the `distance` from the target.
- Showing with a background `overlay` above content.
- Controlling the Surface it uses for children, `sizeRadius`, `elevation` etc.
- Controlling the arrow with `arrowSize` or `noArrow`.

For an example of a Popover in action, you can check out `<Tooltip />` which uses a few properties
to turn popovers into effective tooltips.

To use a Popover:

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples [Beta]

Popover is currently in Beta. While it handles many very complex use cases, it breaks in other
simple ones. A truly effective popover is a really hard problem, and we've spent years refining on
various use cases, but in the course of time other ones have broken. Currently showing a popover
"above" content breaks fairly consistently. We're planning on revisiting this shortly and fixing
many bugs.
