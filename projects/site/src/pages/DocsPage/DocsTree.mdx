A `<Tree />` is a virtualized treeview, built to handle hundreds of thousands of elements, and with
selection, expansion, and keyboard movement built in. Trees use a denormalized style data structure,
so you'll need to convert any array into an object before your use a tree.

To use a Tree:

```tsx
import { Tree } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples

### Basics

Lists are simple to use. The items are dynamically sized, and most of the elements like icon, title,
subtitle, and children accept any `ReactNode` you'd prefer. You can add extra elements using
`before` and `after`.
