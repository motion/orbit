# (Home) Orbit - The Decentralized OS

potential lead-lines:

- Search everything

name of it:

- The Decentralized OS
- Decentralized Operating Layer
- Personal OS

Orbit is a smart operating layer above Mac, Windows, and Linux. It unifies your cloud knowledge and gives you amazing search. But that's just the beginning.

# Take control

You not only don't control your information at all, but you also have almost no control over how you experience and manage it.

Orbit gives both of them back to you.

## Your Data

Orbit syncs data 100% privately to your device, we never even have access your keys. For once your Slack, Jira, Confluence, Gmail, Gdrive, and many other integrations can live privately, instantly, and easily accessible right on your desktop.

## Your Apps

But that's just where it starts. Orbit is an entire app platform that gives you, the end user, control. Our biggest feature is putting the individual in charge. Now you can extend, manage, script, and visualize information with complete control, without ever risking a bit of your data.
