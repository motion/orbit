## INTODUCTION

#1 im excited because this is something we've been working on for quite a while now and i think formidable is the exact type of company we've been talking with and aiming at but have been waiting to prove out a few things, and we're finally not just there but close to ready to deploy it at a company your size.

so what is orbit? it's essentially a really great way to keep up to date with things going on in your company, especially things you missed that you may have wanted to see.

the goal is really to reduce a huge amount of noise and FOMO, while giving everyone the feeling that this is their home plate for whats happening in the company.

so thats a big bag of nice words, let me break down how it workss.

## PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

the big problem we started with was how do we allow people to focus and just get work done, given the massive noise going on in slack, and epecially in not missing things they would normally be interested in that would require massive time sink in checking lots of chat rooms.

[solution to slack noise explanation]

from there we just wanted to sort of use the power of unifying all your cloud knowledge for good, and so we made it have work well across all your company info.

that manifests as state of the art NLP based search. and a nice directory of everyone with unified profiles across the different cloud integrations.

so thats the user focus and daily news which is the big part of orbit.

## ALIGNMENT

so, no one wants to worry about all the mess of privacy, security, and deployment issues of trusting some company with all your private data in the cloud or even installing some big system on premise. that was clear early on, and i mention it because it explains how we are aligning orbit.

so we wanted to make it a personal tool. something you love on your own as a powerful agent that keeps you informed and smart, and is always at your fingertips. and that meant doing it all on-device.

so once you download orbit everything happens between your computer, you directly oauth to various services with no middle-man.

the final piece i think is important to understand here is the less concrete benefit i think but actually probably the big value add for the company which is a feeling of a home base.

so thats the final big insight we had building this, and thats that your intranet could feel like a gift and a beautiful thing, and not something you are forcing on people and where content goes to die.

## POTENTIAL

we think there's actually huge room for growth here. we have a few smart features to help curate important onboarding documents. [we have an incredible surprise feature thats actually working already for in-app contextual help to let you know if you missed something as you're talking or writing an email.]

and importantly, imagine powerful curation tools that surface team status information, onboarding docs, and automatically sort messy drive folders into logical groups.

## SUMMARY

so thats the state of Orbit now, and our plans for the future. i reached out to Ken because he's been one of my favorite people both in supporting America, and kicking out cool react projects, but also because i knew he agrees with me that it hasn't felt like our computers are moving into the future. we want to show the world with Orbit that the web has some real legs behind it, and that if you put the right time and effort in you can actually provide practical machine learning that solves real problems.

and of course, Formidable being a remote company, i thought this would be the perfect place to trial it.

## PITCH

* basically want to roll it out with one small team, see how they like it, and then spread slowly.
* basically work alongside them in some sense. could work out of seattle office for a while.
* if goes well, would basically just have its own github issue tracker. formidable team could open tickets, make requests, discuss features all in open
* formidable can stay grandfathered in as free!
