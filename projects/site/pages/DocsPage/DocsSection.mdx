The `<Section />` component is an easy way to place content that wants to live in its own area,
typically with a title. Sections are collapsable, and will add spacing, padding and borders when you
add the `bordered` prop so they stand out.

To use a Section:

```tsx
import { Section } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples

### Basics

<Example id="Simple" />

### Bordered and Collapsable

<Example id="Full" />
