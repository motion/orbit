what we are

a personal mac app that unifies various work information (mail, slack, jira, etc...) and uses nlp to give a daily summary of what you've missed / important in your company as well as a rich search and explore interface for your cloud (with projects, teams, etc).

it's aim is to reduce notification overload, communication silos & work FOMO.

a potential final "one more thing" feature that we have partially working is that while it normally takes over spotlight as a sidebar drawer, it also can operate contextually to any app. so holding option anywhere on your mac attaches it to that app and uses some pretty cool and very fast custom OCR/content finding to actually use your current screen as a search to see if you missed any related conversations, documents, etc.

it's nearest neighbors would be Stripe Home, Spotlight, maybe Rapportive/Clippy for the context part, running privately/locally on your computer. If it sounds a bit messy, it's because we're still in mid-r&d so we're constraint fitting the final featureset.

goals

* broadly
  * significantly reduce workplace stress
  * increase ability to focus / deep work
  * reduce communication silos and unknowns
  * make internal company ops 10x clearer
* narrowly
  * dailys heads up
  * reduce notification overload
  * reduce missing out on conversations/topics
  * make latent org knowledge more useful
  * (later) replace intranet

strategy

* replace your spotlight/notification drawer with a smart intranet work-focused app

product strategy

* desktop app = far more powerful, present minute to minute (super high engagement)
* attach to any window = contextually relevant, smarter, engagement
* no cloud = can aggressively soak in all their integrations (more value)
* no cloud = enables extreme cross integration features (calendar x docs x hr x ...)
* nlp = able to answer harder questions and do more useful summaries
* nlp = able to tackle bigger problem areas with less tools and time
* ocr = able to work with any app you use + makes a badass demo

go to market strategy

* no cloud = privacy / aligment with end users = user confidence (no one but apple does)
* high user alignment + beautiful product = super high potential end user brand dedication
* invest more into branding = more ability to work with people during beta for launch
* app = easy to get high user count initially
  * because of this makes sense generally to have:
    * longer beta
    * give to big names for launch
    * invest more in nice branding
    * have better design
    * have more thought through, broad features
* very unique technology, go-to-market, and product means lots of juice for PR/articles:
  * want to spend more time in beta and pre-write a lot of topics covering various areas with high chance of spreading virally / appearing on HN homepage
  * tech articles alone could have an article every other week on HN for first few months
  * unique desktop/privacy/notification stress/deep work ... memes have high kinetic energy
* include a few but very high audience influencers in our beta, potentially even as investors
  * people like patrick collison, john gruber, various high influence programmers, etc
  * anyone who promoted superhuman, meteor, + influential in design community (khoi vinh etc)

keys to success

* making the summary really work well
* befriending our integration companies
* working a long beta with influential people
* ensuring the PR around user-alignment catches (not scary big brother)
  * this requires us to have clear user-friendly monetization plan from start

how features justify inclusion

* news
  * makes us valuable to end-users directly
  * does the previously impossible (what did i miss)
* search
  * allows us to take over cmd+space/spotlight/notifications drawer
    * == high engagement, nice design
* explore
  * it's what we can sell to _companies_ because it gives them control
    * they can curate their home sections
    * they get value from a nice org chart
  * its the area that can grow most in terms of price-point value
* context "one more thing"
  * helps justify the big ask of taking over their various shortcuts and onboard time
  * amazing for demo / brand
  * gives us novelty factor which increases virality big time
  * actually has huge business case once it works well
    * dont forget how awesome it would feel to have an agent looking out for you

risks

* setup time with integrations will take a while
  * onboard focus and demo impressiveness should help
