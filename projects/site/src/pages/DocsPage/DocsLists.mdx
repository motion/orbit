A `<List />` is the highest level and most powerful list view in the interface kit.
It is virtualized by default, but acts almost entirely like a non-virtualized list.
It has many features built-in, including:

- Ordering, filtering, searching, and grouping through `useFilter()` props.
- Selections and multi-selections through `useSelection()` props.
- Sortable through the `sortable` prop.
- Shows a title, subtitle, padding, elevation and more through `<Section />` props.
- Sharing to the [Share menu]() through `shareable` prop.
- Keyboard navigation through the `Shortcut` store.
- Sizeable with the `scale` prop.

To use a List:

```tsx
import { List } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples

### Basics

Lists are simple to use:

<Example examples={Ex} source={ExSource} id="Simple" />

### Grouping, sorting, searching

Lists have built in support for grouping, searching, sorting, and filtering. This is important for building
many types of apps, and all of these props must work together.

Grouping works by setting the `separator` prop for each `<ListItem />` automatically.

<Example examples={Ex} source={ExSource} id="Grouping" />

Because all text elements are higlightable, searching will automatically highlight the found phrases. Here we are searching for "st" and sorting them by their email address.

<Example examples={Ex} source={ExSource} id="OrderFilter" name="Search + Sort" />

### Using as a section

Orbit aims to make building apps easy, so many of the high level views are wrapped in a `<Section />`. List is no exception.
This lets you quickly and easily show a list, elevate it, add a title and subtitle, and make it collapsable.

<Example examples={Ex} source={ExSource} id="Section" name="Using as Section" />
