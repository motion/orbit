# Unsilo (Cloud Lock-In)

* looking around at the cloud theres a hell of a lot of silos
* gsuite cloud search
* only works for google services
* ms365
* only works for microsoft
* Dropbox, Jira, etc
* Our knowledge is locked into platforms
* But they don't operate in the same platforms, ideally
* slack
* confluence, intercom, etc
* how to solve lock in?
* a company dedicated to unifying cloud services.
* its _sole mission_ must be to unify the cloud
* but it has to do it without breaking permission, security.

Orbit does that.

# A Decentralized Intranet

* intranets solve the same problems: curation, news, search, profiles
* but they dont work how we work now: across many services
* they are always out of date, because they dont use our sources of truth
* install is a huge pain:
  * on-prem is laborious and expensive
  * cloud is insecure and creates permissions hell
* on device is the answer:
  * completely secure
  * install can be instant and painless
* p2p can sync any metadata for curation
* aggregation is the new curation
* machine intelligence for smart answers, summaries and more
* eventually deploy apps internally with ease
* Orbit

# The Stunning Lack of Ambition of OS X Mojave

* We were promised Software 2.0
* iOS gets: Notification noise reduction
  * where is that on OS X?
* Dark theme is the big feature
* Why does spotlight not search your cloud services?
* Does anyone use Notification center on Mac?
* This looks like a Step release
* WAIT
* Apple focusing on performance is important and good
* but it leaves room for companies doing intelligent software
* and especially for work related tooling
* desktop software doesnt work with us
