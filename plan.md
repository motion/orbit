goals

* broadly
  * make internal company ops 10x clearer
  * make your company feel cohesive and up to date
  * improve remote workers sense of unity
  * reduce workplace stress and FOMO
  * increase ability to turn off notifications and focus / deep work
  * reduce communication silos and unknowns

product strategy

* desktop app = far more powerful, present minute to minute (super high engagement)
* attach to any window = contextually relevant, smarter, engagement
* no cloud = can safely soak in all their integrations (more value)
* no cloud = enables extreme cross integration features (calendar x docs x hr x ...)
* nlp = able to answer harder questions and do more useful summaries
* nlp = able to tackle bigger problem areas with less tools and time
* ocr = able to work with any app you use + makes a badass demo

go to market strategy

* no cloud = privacy / aligment with end users = user confidence (no one but apple does)
* no cloud = insanely easy onboarding, no big sales process
* private on device = useful to any user not just whole team or company
* high user alignment + beautiful product = high potential end user brand dedication
* smart app = easy to get high user count initially
  * because of this makes sense generally to have:
    * longer beta
    * give to big names for launch
    * invest more in nice branding
    * have better design
    * have more thought through, broad features
* very unique technology, go-to-market, and product means lots of juice for PR/articles:
  * want to spend more time in beta and pre-write a lot of topics covering various areas with high chance of spreading virally / appearing on HN homepage
  * tech articles alone could have an article every other week on HN for first few months
  * unique desktop/privacy/notification stress/deep work ... memes have high kinetic energy
* include a few but very high audience influencers in our beta, potentially even as investors
  * people like patrick collison, john gruber, various high influence programmers, etc
  * anyone who promoted superhuman, meteor, + influential in design community (khoi vinh etc)

keys to success

* making the summary really work well
* having a properly impressive launch
* working with some big SV influencers early in beta to get hype
* ensuring the messaging around user-alignment is clear (not scary big brother)
* monetize from the start

how features justify inclusion

* news
  * makes us valuable to end-users directly
  * does the previously impossible (what did i miss)
* search
  * allows us to take over cmd+space/spotlight/notifications drawer
    * == high engagement, nice design
* explore
  * it's what we can sell to _companies_ because it gives them control
    * they can curate their home sections
    * they get value from a nice org chart
  * its the area that can grow most in terms of price-point value
* context "one more thing"
  * helps justify the big ask of taking over their various shortcuts and onboard time
  * amazing for demo / brand
  * gives us novelty factor which increases virality big time
  * actually has huge business case once it works well
    * dont forget how awesome it would feel to have an agent looking out for you

risks

* setup time with integrations will take a while
  * onboard focus and demo impressiveness should help
* this is a hard problem, lots to solve
* many companies have different needs, may be pit of complexity in real world
* may be hard to scale doing on-devices

demo video
