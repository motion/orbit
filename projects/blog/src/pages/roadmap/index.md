title: Roadmap

## October

We'll be aiming for stability, some interface improvements, and integrating a variety of topic modeling improvements to make search more accurate and exploration a more intuitive and useful.

Our secondary goal will be to get a prototype of Context / realtime search released under a flag and to have a spec for the app store, along with making a few steps towards releasing that as a prototype.

- Topics modeling:
  - Search will allow you to drill down using topics from the current results.
- Search usability and accuracy:
  - Integrating better filtering via our FTS5 branch
  - The next iteration of cosal integration will improve topic search.
  - Fix a variety of bugs and slow areas in search interface.
- A run over the peek windows for individual bits:
  - Show more metadata
  - Showing related items using Language
  - Design and speed improvements
- Apps:
  - Website crawler syncer

## November - December

The rest of the year will focus on getting into what we'll consider ready for Beta:

- Most of it will be focused on stability, usability, and bugfixing
- Integrating the Context and getting it to be usable
- Integrating the App Store, local development environment, and p2p distribution
