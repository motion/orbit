# Onboard

Download Orbit.app
Set it up for yourself!

If you want to create a custom feed for your team:

1. Add feed integration (RSS or DB/Api etc)
2. Configure it's incoming, name, filters

Hit "Share my Orbit"...

What it does:

1. This will share your configuration but not your integrations!
2. So you can share it any people will just set up the same integrations as you so its scoped to their privacy.
3. If you'd like to configure any integrations as global you can in preferences.

How it works:

By default you are in a Personal Orbit. But you can have many Orbits.

Orbits are collections of:

- Apps (not including the secure logins)
- Screens

# App

- Basically just a syncer + some views

# Screen

- Basically a named pane that with custom streams
- Stream:
  - Just a search
  - Can be a filter by integration, location, keywords

The owner of an Orbit is a dictator over his App/Screen settings.

You can switch between Orbits incredibly easily and manage them from your preferences pane.

# Manage Orbit

A classic preference pane. Orbits have a uniqueid that you can set.

They don't have a password, they can be private and only allow specific usernames in.

# Username

This means everyone needs a specific username. Can be tied to a personal email.
