* what problems

  * notification noise / incoming overload
  * stress / deep work / fomo
  * duplicate work
  * reducing unecessary reach-out interruptions
  * lack of a coherent home for your company

* how we do it

  * UNIFIED SIDEBAR
    * unified home
    * notification noise
    * deep work
    * how:
      * unified cloud sidebar (upgrade your cmd+space)
      * DAILY SUMMARY: novel nlp news on what you missed (PULL not PUSH)
      * TOPICS: see and search anything by meaning to get clearer view of company
      * PROFILES: aggregated profiles: where they hang, talk about, recent activity
      * SEARCH: meaning based search for all your stuff
  * CONTEXTUAL SIDEBAR / HIGHLIGHT WORDS
    * unknown unknowns
    * duplicate work
    * prevents interruptions
    * how:
      * OCR scans with almost no cpu usage as you work
      * hold option to see sidebar on every app
      * NLP then shows relevant mail, docs, convos, projects in sidebar
      * works with every app, even with slack in realtime while talking
      * indicates if there is an important term, person, or project

* what we want to do going forward

  * give your company a really nice home
  * better project & profile views
  * better explore/curation
    * pin results to top of searches
    * explorable sets of things
  * application
    * hook into all the cool features (contextual, nlp)
    * provide a really nice base for building (data, style, ui kit)

## INTODUCTION

#1 im excited because this is something we've been working on for quite a while now and i think formidable is the exact type of company we've been talking with in our research but have been waiting to get to your guys before we really proved out a few things, and we're finally pretty close!

[very very briefly introduce us/company]

so for the past year we've been really working hard at solving the base problem that people are stressed, overloaded by inbound, and generally unclear on what other people are doing in their company.

specifically, as we talked more and more with people we got consistent feedback: we love slack, but it causes a ton of noise and stress. the airtable CEO told me: "solve the mess of slack, and i'll throw money at you". so that's really been our first foot forward.

so how does it work exactly?

## PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

so how do you solve this big problem of taming all the noise going on in your company. when we first set out to solve this we had the same idea we think many people have

, and epecially in not missing things they would normally be interested in that would require massive time sink in checking lots of chat rooms.

[solution to slack noise explanation]

from there we just wanted to sort of use the power of unifying all your cloud knowledge for good, and so we made it have work well across all your company info.

that manifests as state of the art NLP based search. and a nice directory of everyone with unified profiles across the different cloud integrations.

[explain nlp]

so thats the user focus and daily news which is the big part of orbit.

## ALIGNMENT

so, no one wants to worry about all the mess of privacy, security, and deployment issues of trusting some company with all your private data in the cloud or even installing some big system on premise. that was clear early on, and i mention it because it explains how we are aligning orbit.

so we wanted to make it a personal tool. something you love on your own as a powerful agent that keeps you informed and smart, and is always at your fingertips. and that meant doing it all on-device.

so once you download orbit everything happens between your computer, you directly oauth to various services with no middle-man.

the final piece i think is important to understand here is the less concrete benefit i think but actually probably the big value add for the company which is a feeling of a home base.

[explain pitch of remote workers feeling unified]

so thats the final big insight we had building this, and thats that your intranet could feel like a gift and a beautiful thing, and not something you are forcing on people and where content goes to die.

## POTENTIAL

we think there's actually huge room for growth here. we have a few smart features to help curate important onboarding documents. [we have an incredible surprise feature thats actually working already for in-app contextual help to let you know if you missed something as you're talking or writing an email.]

and importantly, imagine powerful curation tools that surface team status information, onboarding docs, and automatically sort messy drive folders into logical groups.

## SUMMARY

so thats the state of Orbit now, and our plans for the future. i reached out to Ken because he's been one of my favorite people both in supporting America, and kicking out cool react projects, but also because i knew he agrees with me that it hasn't felt like our computers are moving into the future. we want to show the world with Orbit that the web has some real legs behind it, and that if you put the right time and effort in you can actually provide practical machine learning that solves real problems.

and of course, Formidable being a remote company, i thought this would be the perfect place to trial it.

## PITCH

* basically want to roll it out with one small team, see how they like it, and then spread slowly.
* basically work alongside them in some sense. could work out of seattle office for a while.
* if goes well, would basically just have its own github issue tracker. formidable team could open tickets, make requests, discuss features all in open
* formidable can stay grandfathered in as free!
