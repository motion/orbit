Use the following scenarios to troubleshoot.\n:subtitle: Dropbox says someone left a shared folder\nUsers can inadvertently leave a shared folder by nesting a shared folder or moving the folder (both are explained in detail below). Here are other common ways that a member can unknowingly leave a shared folder:\nThe owner or a member deletes the entire shared folder. Deleting a shared folder removes you from the folder, but not other members.\nAntivirus software or backup applications can prevent Dropbox from syncing a shared folder, which causes a user to leave the shared folder. Check the settings of antivirus and backup applications to determine if they interfere with Dropbox.\n:subtitle: A shared folder is moved inside another folder\nShared folders can’t be \"nested\" within another folder. If you move a shared folder into another folder, you create a copy of the shared folder. Since you aren’t a member of the original shared folder, you can't see changes that other members make to files in that folder.\nTo resolve, add the original shared folder back to your Dropbox. When you re-add the folder you'll see the latest versions of the files in that folder, including changes made while you weren't a member. Changes you made to files in your unshared copy of the folder do not sync.\n:subtitle: A member moved a shared folder out of Dropbox\nIf you move a shared folder out of your Dropbox (for example, to an external hard drive or your computer desktop), Dropbox thinks you’ve left the shared folder. You no longer see changes members make to files in that folder.\nTo resolve, add the original shared folder back to your Dropbox. When you re-add the folder you'll see the latest versions of the files in that folder, including changes made while you weren't a member. Changes you made to files in your unshared copy of the folder do not sync.\n:subtitle: A shared folder has the same name as another folder\nIf you join a shared folder that has the same name as a folder already in your Dropbox, a (1) is appended to the shared folder name.\nTo resolve, rename the original folder causing the naming conflict. Then you can remove the (1) from the shared folder name."},{"title":"A shared link stopped working or shows a 404 error  Dropbox","body":":title: A shared link stopped working, or shows a 404 error – Dropbox\nFile owners can share files and folders on a read-only basis with a shared link. If you received a shared link, click it to preview the files or folder that were shared with you.\nWhether you sent a shared link or received one, a link may fail to work or show a 404 error. If this happens, check the following:\nHas the file or folder been deleted? To re-establish the link, restore the file or folder. As soon as you restore the file or folder, the shared link will work again.\nHas the link been disabled? Sign in at dropbox.com and click Links in the left-hand sidebar. If you don't see the link in your list, you may have removed it at some point. You can always create a new link to the file of folder you want to share.\nHas the link expired? If you're a Dropbox Professional or Dropbox Business user, and you set an expiration for your shared link, it may have expired. In that case, you need to create a new link to the file or folder.\nIs the file in a shared folder? Did the owner change its settings? If you're a Dropbox Business user or a team user, the owner of a shared folder may have changed the sharing settings to specify that links can only be shared with other team members (and not externally).\nDid an admin change sharing settings for your team. If you're a Dropbox Business user, your admin may have turned off the ability to share links with people outside the team. If so, shared links that you've created won't work for people outside the team unless your admin turns this permission back on.\nDoes a shared link take you back to your Dropbox? If you already have access to a file or folder (in other words, if the file owner has shared it with you before), clicking a shared link will bring you directly to your Dropbox. This works for folders too: if you already have a folder in your Dropbox, clicking a shared link that points to that folder will take you to its location in your Dropbox.\nDoes a shared link fail to open in your browser? If you click a shared link and it fails to open, you may be encountering a browser issue. To correct this, sign out of Dropbox and then click the shared link again.\n:subtitle: Banned links\nWe ban shared links when they're responsible for unusually large amounts of traffic, or when they violate our Acceptable Use Policy (for example, by hosting spam or malware).\nLearn more about traffic limits and banned links.\n:subtitle: Too many invitations\nIf you're a Dropbox Basic user who is creating shared links, you may get the error message You are trying to share with too many people at once. This means that you surpassed the daily limit for shared folder and link invitations. The limit resets daily, so try to share your files the next day.\n:subtitle: Important note on copyrighted material\nYou should only use shareable links for files that you have the legal right to share with others (for example, documents, photos, software, music, and videos that you personally created). You do not have the right to share files unless you own the copyright in them or have been given permission by the copyright owner to share them. Purchasing or legally acquiring video, music, ebooks, or software does not give you the right to share that material with third parties over the Internet.\nIf you have any doubts about whether you have the legal right to share certain files, you should not share them. You represent that files shared using shareable links do not violate Dropbox’s Terms of Service and that you own all copyrights to them or have been given permission by the copyright owner to share them. Dropbox has adopted a policy of terminating the accounts of users who repeatedly infringe copyright or whose accounts are subject to multiple infringement allegations.

However, because your photos may contain information about where they were taken, Dropbox (like other apps) needs special permission to access them.\nIf you turn on the background uploading option in the Camera Upload settings, the app will ask for permission to access your iPhone's location services. This will enable the app to finish large uploads without the need for you to open the app.\nHere's how it works: Normally, photos and videos can upload while the Dropbox app is open and for only a few minutes after it is closed. But with background uploading turned on, the app will automatically resume unfinished uploads when it detects a significant change in your iPhone's location. This feature is designed to make your Camera Uploads work more efficiently and does not collect your location information.\nUnderstanding iOS Location Services\nFor information such as how to tell when an app is using location services, steps to reset or change your location settings, and to learn more about iOS location services, see Apple's Understanding Location Services support article.\nApple's API reference\nFor iOS developers or highly technical readers, check out Apple's Developer documentation to learn more about the API library Dropbox uses to access iPhone and iPad photo galleries."},{"title":"Banned links or file requests  Dropbox","body":":title: Banned links or file requests – Dropbox\nIf your shared links or file requests have stopped working, and you've ruled out other causes, they may have been banned because of too much traffic.

Here are some easy and common password protection techniques to keep your online accounts safe.\n:subtitle: Choose unique passwords for each service you use\nThe safest thing to do is to choose unique passwords for each service you use and guard them closely. If you’ve ever used the same password for more than one website, you should create new unique passwords for each of them.\nTools like 1Password can help you manage strong passwords across multiple sites and help make your accounts safer.\n:subtitle: Enable two-step verification\nTwo-step verification will add an extra layer of security to your account. Every time you sign in to Dropbox, you'll be required to enter the code sent to your phone or a one-time, time-limited code generated from a supported mobile app, like Google Authenticator. This is a highly effective way to protect your account from unauthorized access. To enable two-step verification, follow the steps in this help center article.\n:subtitle: Create strong passwords and test them\nA good password is one that is easy for you to remember but hard for a stranger to guess. Uncommon words work well, but only if you use several together. The following are also helpful:\nNon-standard uppercasing (for example, \"uPPercasing\")\nNon-standard word spelling (for example, \"spellllllling\")\nUsing personal slang words\nNon-obvious numbers and symbols (note: using \"$\" for \"s\" or \"0\" for \"o\" is fairly common and likely not enough of a security measure).\nYou can use the Dropbox password strength estimator to test your password here.\nTo learn more about how our password strength estimator works, you can read the post on our Tech blog.\n:subtitle: Change your passwords from time to time\nAnother way to help keep your passwords secure is by keeping them fresh.

What that means to you is faster, safe and reliable syncing.\nBefore transferring a file, we compare the new file to the previous version and only send the piece of the file that changed.

Admins can then use account capture to force these users to migrate that personal account to the Enterprise team, or to change the email address of the corporate email domain. Finally, admins can use domain insights to track this unauthorized usage of the company domain over time.\nSee below for instructions to get started.\nSee domain insights and account capture in action on the Dropbox blog.\n:subtitle: Step one: Establish domain ownership\nSign in to dropbox.com with your admin account.\nOpen the Admin Console.\nClick Settings.\nUnder Members, click Domains.\nClick Add domain.\nEnter the company domain you'd like to verify ownership of.\nSelect one of the three verification methods.\nFollow the instructions on screen—once you've completed the verification, you'll receive an email notifying you that your domain ownership was successful.\n:subtitle: What if I have more than one domain to verify, or I want to verify a subdomain?\nTeam admins can choose to verify a primary domain, which is the top-level domain of their website (for example, “dropbox.com”.)

This is a secure and relatively fast option, since Dropbox will be able to see the changes as soon as they are live on your website.\nIf you don't have access to modify your website directly, or you don't have a website hosted at the domain you'd like to verify, you can create a TXT record on your domain host's website.\nMost domain hosting services should have this functionality, however the specific steps on each service will vary. If you are unable to locate the steps for modifying your DNS configuration, please contact your domain host's support team or documentation for help. Dropbox cannot provide domain host support.\nNote: Once you've made the changes on your domain host, it may take as long as a day for your changes to propagate across your website's domain servers.

Verifying a subdomain won’t show this option.\n:subtitle: Which verification method is right for me?\nThere are three different ways you can verify your domain:\nAdd a meta tag\nUpload an HTML file\nCreate a TXT record\nFor either of the first two options (adding a meta tag or uploading an HTML file), you'll likely need access to modify the code on your website. This is a secure and relatively fast option, since Dropbox will be able to see the changes as soon as they are live on your website.\nIf you don't have access to modify your website directly, or you don't have a website hosted at the domain you'd like to verify, you can create a TXT record on your domain host's website.\nMost domain hosting services should have this functionality, however the specific steps on each service will vary. If you are unable to locate the steps for modifying your DNS configuration, please contact your domain host's support team or documentation for help. Dropbox cannot provide domain host support.\nNote: Once you've made the changes on your domain host, it may take as long as a day for your changes to propagate across your website's domain servers. Dropbox will continue checking until the process is complete, and email you once the changes are live.\n:subtitle: Step two: Enable invite enforcement for your domains\nOnce you have established domain ownership, you can enable invite enforcement for each domain. Enabling invite enforcement will cause all existing and future invites on this domain to be enforced—that is, users will be forced to either join your team, or to change the email on their existing Dropbox or Paper account to an address that does not use your verified domain. To enable invite enforcement:\nSign in to dropbox.com using your admin account.\nOpen the Admin Console.\nClick Settings.\nUnder Members, click Domains.\nClick the gear icon beside the domain you have verified ownership of.\nClick Change capture settings.\nSelect Invited users.\nOnce you have completed these steps, all existing and future invites will be enforced on this domain.\n:subtitle: What if I wasn't able to complete domain verification?\nIf you were unable to complete the domain verification process, you can do so later using the Fix verification option.\nNote: Dropbox will not provide any user information or enable invite enforcement until you successfully verify domain ownership."},{"title":"Download entire folders on dropboxcom  Dropbox","body":":title: Download entire folders on dropbox.com – Dropbox\nYou can download the contents of an entire Dropbox folder via dropbox.com, as long as both of the following are true:\nThe folder is less than 20 GB in total size\nThe folder has fewer than 10,000 total files\nTo download an entire folder directly from dropbox.com:\nSign in to dropbox.com.\nFind the folder you want to download.\nClick the … (ellipsis) icon to the right of the folder's name.\nClick Download.\nYour browser will then download the folder as a single compressed file (known as a \"ZIP\" file).

Organizations like hospitals, doctors' offices, and dental practices, as well as individuals who interact with protected health information (PHI) may be subject to HIPAA/HITECH. This may also extend to companies that work with these businesses and come into contact with PHI on their behalf.\n:subtitle: HIPAA/HITECH Key Terms\nProtected Health Information (PHI)\nIndividually identifiable information that relates to someone's past, present, or future:\nmedical or psychological condition.\nprovision of medical service.\npayments for medical service.\nCovered entity\nA covered entity is a health plan, health care clearinghouse, or health care provider. These categories include hospitals, clinics, doctors, and others who create, receive, or transmit PHI. Because of their contact with PHI, covered entities are responsible for the privacy and security of that information under HIPAA/HITECH.\nBusiness associate\nA business associate is an entity which creates, receives, maintains, or transmits PHI on behalf of a covered entity and is therefore also subject to HIPAA/HITECH rules.\nBusiness associate agreement (BAA)\nA BAA is a contractual assurance from the business associate to the covered entity that they follow HIPAA's requirements. This agreement must be in place before the transfer of PHI from the covered entity to the business associate.\n:subtitle: Is Dropbox HIPAA/HITECH Certified?\nThere is no official HIPAA/HITECH certification.

Entering your computer username and password in this dialog box simply gives Dropbox the permissions it needs to enable these features.\n:subtitle: Is this a Dropbox dialog box?\nNo. This is an Apple system dialog box, not a dialog from Dropbox. Mac OS X requires password authentication for changes to certain permissions, and this dialog box is a standard way for a Mac OS X app to ask for your permission.\n:subtitle: Can I disable these permissions?\nYes, you can choose to click Cancel rather than approving these additional permissions. However, this means that the Dropbox features listed above will not function on your computer. If you don’t give your approval, you will be asked to enter your username and password again the next time you start or restart Dropbox.\n:subtitle: How do these permissions relate to Accessibility?\nYou may have noticed a listing for Dropbox under the list of Accessibility apps on your computer.

Unfortunately, some Mac OS X permissions aren't as detailed as we'd like. This means that multiple permissions can be included in the same approval dialog.\nDropbox does explicitly ask for permission to access Accessibility on macOS Sierra (10.12) and above. In the coming weeks, we will explicitly ask for user permission on Mac OS X (10.11) and below.\n:subtitle: What will happen if I disable Accessibility access?\nAt this time, if you disable Dropbox Accessibility the change is overridden the next time you restart your computer.\nWe're aware that this is not ideal, and we want to do a better job with how we ask for permissions. Our team is working to change the fact that Accessibility permissions for Dropbox are re-added when you restart your computer.\nThe latest version of the Dropbox desktop app introduces a more explicit permissions flow for the latest version of macOS.

However, even if you update to the latest version of Dropbox you may still notice some unexpected behavior. Specifically:\nApple error messages or other dialogue boxes appearing when files are moved into Dropbox\nConfusing sync icons appearing on the Dropbox folder, or files in the folder\nIf Dropbox is in its default location you will see error messages when moving files from folders that are being synced by iCloud (like Desktop or Documents) and into Dropbox.\nIf Dropbox has been moved to the Desktop or Documents folder, and these are being synced by iCloud, you may experience confusing sync icons on Dropbox.\nThese messages and icons are due to the way Apple has implemented iCloud (their storage and backup solution). This article gives additional details on how to best experience Dropbox on the latest version of macOS.\n:subtitle: What can I do if I’m seeing these icons and messages?\nUpdate to the latest version of Dropbox.\nUpdating to this version means you’ll have the latest Dropbox improvements, and ensures you’ll have the smoothest possible experience using Dropbox on the latest version of macOS.\nMove Dropbox back to its default location.\nHosting Dropbox in its default location can prevent file syncing conflicts between iCloud and Dropbox.\nDisable notifications when removing files from iCloud Drive:\nOpen Finder.\nOpen Finder Preferences.\nClick Advanced.\nUncheck Show warning before removing from iCloud Drive.\nNote: Disabling iCloud notifications will not remove the conflicting sync icons.\n:subtitle: When will my files sync to Dropbox?\nYou may notice that the sync icons on your files shift back and forth between iCloud and Dropbox notifications. This can happen if:\nYou have iCloud enabled on your computer\nYou have synced the Desktop or Documents folder to iCloud\nYou have moved your Dropbox folder to either the Desktop or Documents folder\nIn this case the Dropbox sync icon (the green circle with a checkmark) won't appear until a file has completed syncing to both Dropbox and iCloud.\nLearn more about each of the Dropbox sync icons.\n:subtitle: Why am I seeing these messages or icons?\nError messages will appear on the latest version of macOS when each of the following two criteria are true:\nYou have iCloud enabled on your computer\nYou have synced the Desktop or Documents folder to iCloud\nConflicting sync icons will appear when each of the following three criteria are true:\nYou have iCloud enabled on your computer\nYou have synced the Desktop or Documents folder to iCloud\nYou have moved your Dropbox folder to either the Desktop or Documents folder\nNote: In the latest version of macOS, iCloud sync is enabled on these folders by default during installation.\n:subtitle: Is Dropbox still working if I’m seeing these messages or icons?\nYes. Even if you’re seeing these icons or messages, your files are still being saved to Dropbox. However, you may notice the file sync icons shift from Dropbox to iCloud icons and back again while they save.\n:subtitle: What are the error messages, and what do they mean?\nIf you are syncing the Desktop or Documents folder to iCloud, you may see one of the following dialogue boxes when moving files to Dropbox:\nThese messages will appear if you try to move files out of the Desktop or Documents folder. By default, iCloud syncs your  Desktop and Documents folders. When you move a file out of thee folders into your Dropbox folder, iCloud interprets moving a file from Desktop or Documents as an attempt to delete the file from iCloud.\n:subtitle: Can I use both Dropbox and iCloud?\nYes. However, using both Dropbox and iCloud may lead to some of the issues outlined in this article. We do not currently support a configuration where both iCloud and Dropbox sync the same files.\n:subtitle: Potential issues with Dropbox and iCloud placeholder files\niCloud will not sync or delete Dropbox files if Dropbox is in its default configuration. However, if all of the following are true for your configuration, then you could potentially lose data on Dropbox:\nYou name your Dropbox folder something other than \"Dropbox\" (for example \"Dropbox 1\"), and\nYour Dropbox folder is saved in a non-default location (the Desktop or Documents folder), and\niCloud syncing is on, and\niCloud Optimized Storage is enabled\nIf all of these are true for your configuration then iCloud may remove local copies of files and replace them with placeholder files (.icloud). This happens if both disk space is low and Optimized Storage is enabled. If Dropbox is syncing the same files, then Dropbox will sync the original file removal and the .iCloud placeholder file.\nIn rare cases, moving Dropbox to its default location after Optimized Storage had already replaced real files with placeholder files can lead to data loss. Dropbox will sync these placeholder files instead of the actual files.\nThis issue could lead to data loss if no action is taken. Follow these steps to verify all your files are safe:\nSign in to dropbox.com.\nType .iCloud into the search bar to see which—if any—of your files are affected.\nIf you find .iCloud files, you'll need to recover the actual versions from iCloud.\nOnce you've recovered files from iCloud, follow the steps listed earlier in this article to guard against further data loss.\nAdditional cases with .iCloud placeholder links:\nIn addition to the issues discussed above, there is also a potential issue with screenshots. In some rare cases, screenshots taken while Dropbox isn’t running can be replaced with .iCloud placeholders, with the placeholder file then synced to Dropbox.\nFollow the steps detailed earlier to restore any affected screenshots, and to prevent this from happening again.\n:subtitle: Using symlinks, iCloud, and the Dropbox desktop app\nNote: If you use symlinks, you may be at additional risk for unusual behavior or even data loss.\nDropbox is working to address any issues that may arise from using Dropbox with macOS Sierra (version 10.12+). Following the recommendations in this article is the best way to get normal behavior with Dropbox on Sierra.\nHowever, if you have symlinks in your Dropbox that point to the Documents folder or Desktop, you may experience conflicting sync icons or possible data loss even if you follow the recommendations in this article.\nWe recommend removing symlinks from Dropbox to avoid any possible issues.\n:subtitle: What if I’m asked to move my Dropbox folder?\nIf your Dropbox configuration fits the scenario described in the previous section, we will ask you to move your Dropbox folder back to the default location. Selecting the Move option will automatically complete this action. Selecting Cancel will stop Dropbox file sync until you resume sync and move your Dropbox folder back to its default location.\nYou can also manually move your Dropbox folder back to its default location:\nClick the Dropbox icon in your system tray or menu bar.\nClick the gear icon.\nClick Preferences….\nOpen the Account tab.\nClick the dropdown beside Dropbox location.\nSelect Other…\nOpen the Applications list.\nClick the Applications dropdown, and select your hard drive.\nOpen the Users folder.\nSelect your computer username (it will likely have a \"home\" icon beside it).\nClick Select.\nConfirm the move by clicking Move.\n:subtitle: How can I enable the Dropbox badge on macOS Sierra (version 10.12+)?\nWhen installing Dropbox, you will see a dialogue requesting Accessibility permissions:\nClick Give Access to Dropbox—you will be redirected to the Security & Privacy section of System Preferences.\nClick the lock icon; you will be asked to enter your computer username and password.\nOnce unlocked, check the box beside the Dropbox icon to enable Accessibility.\nClick the lock icon again to re-lock system preferences.\n:subtitle: Why does Dropbox need Accessibility access on my Mac?\nDropbox uses macOS Accessibility permissions to function properly.

Depending on what devices and files you're working on, sync can involve both uploading and downloading data between Dropbox storage servers and your device. In short, sync is a complex process that we've worked hard to perfect.\nIf you're experiencing slow sync, you can visit this article to customize the bandwidth Dropbox can use on your device. This article will address factors outside of Dropbox that impact syncing speeds.\nFor a file to sync to Dropbox, it is uploaded from your device to our servers. Dropbox sync works smartly to maximize upload speed; however, upload speed is dependent on your Internet Service Provider (ISP), not Dropbox.\nTo measure your connection on a certain device and at a certain time, you can use a speed test (there are many free speed test tools online). Download and upload speeds are reported in Mb/s (megabits per second not megabytes per second). Higher upload speeds translate to faster syncing, and higher download speeds mean faster downloading and streaming. You can use the upload speed measured by a speed test to estimate how long it will take to sync a particular file.\nWhen you consider your current internet package or shop for a new one, you should take note of these important facts:\nUpload and download speed might differ in the packages offers by ISPs. If you've ever noticed that downloading and streaming in Dropbox is faster than uploading files, then you're experiencing faster download speeds compared to upload speeds.\nISP reported speeds are theoretical maximums—the actual connection you experience may be slower than what your internet package advertises.\nDownload and upload speeds are reported separately by ISPs and speed tests in Mb/s (megabites per second not megabytes per second), while the Dropbox client reports both upload and download speed combined in kB/s. SO be aware that the sync speed reported by the Dropbox client may not match speeds reported by a speed test.\n:subtitle: Latency and sync speed\nLatency measures the response time between your device and a service's server, which means that distance is important to consider when measuring latency. As it travels from device to server, data must perform multiple hops, and more hops increases latency. The further that you are from Dropbox storage servers the longer the period of latency you’ll experience. Latency can explain the disparity you may see between upload seeds in a speed test and your actual Dropbox upload speed.\n:subtitle: Other factors that impact sync speed\nIn addition to the factors described above, the following also play a role in sync speeds:\nTraffic/Packet shaping and Bandwidth limits: ISPs and other organizations set limits on the amount of network traffic allotted to a service or to prioritize bandwidth for certain services over others.\nNetwork Congestion: Too much traffic on a particular network (congestion) impacts connection speed."},{"title":"Dropbox is using more CPU than usual  Dropbox","body":":title: Dropbox is using more CPU than usual – Dropbox\nWhen the Dropbox desktop app reports high CPU usage it is usually due to external factors that conflict with Dropbox. This article lists factors that could explain abnormal CPU usage.\n:subtitle: Third-party apps\nSome third-party apps access files in your Dropbox folder. Dropbox may interpret this access as edits to the files, and it will sync these perceived changes. If a third-party app continually requests access to your files, Dropbox will continue to sync, which will in turn lead to high CPU usage.\nThis loop usually occurs with third-party syncing apps, backup apps, and anti-virus or security software.\nTo isolate a third-party app as the cause of high CPU usage, temporarily disable each third-party app in your Activity Monitor or Task Manager and see if CPU usage for Dropbox decreases.\n:subtitle: Incorrect file permissions\nIf files in your Dropbox folder have incorrectly set permissions, then the Dropbox app will continually try—and fail—to sync them.\nTo ensure files in your Dropbox folder have correct permissions, follow these steps:\nWe recommend that you contact the support organization of your operating system to troubleshoot file permissions on the intended destination for your Dropbox folder.\n:subtitle: A large number of files in your Dropbox folder\nPerformance of the Dropbox desktop app starts to decrease at 300,000 files.\nImprove performance and sync speed, with selective sync.\n:subtitle: Dropbox folder is installed on a NAS device\nThe Dropbox folder should never be installed on a NAS device because our desktop app is not meant to work with network share file systems.\nTo resolve this issue, move your Dropbox folder back to a physically connected drive. Or, follow special steps to correctly use Dropbox with an external drive.\n:subtitle: Your file system doesn’t support extended attributes\nOur desktop app requires that you install the Dropbox data folder on a drive with a file system that supports extended attributes. If installed elsewhere, the app will continually try—and fail—to upload your files. This process causes high CPU use.\nTo solve, move your Dropbox folder to a hard drive or partition with a supported file system.\n:subtitle: Learn more\n:subtitle: Symlinks\nIf you know you have symlinks in your Dropbox folder, remove them to improve the performance of the Dropbox desktop app. Symlinks refer to data in locations outside of the Dropbox folder, so the Dropbox desktop app can get stuck attempting to access them.\nIf you're not sure if you have symlinks in your Dropbox folder, use the steps below to generate a list of any that exist. This list shows you the full file path to every symlink and where the symlink points to outside of the Dropbox folder.\nIn general, we recommend that you move actual data (your files and folders) into the Dropbox folder, and then create a symlink where the data was previously located. That way the symlink is outside of the Dropbox folder and the actual data will sync in your Dropbox. In this arrangement, you'll still be able to access the data at a location outside of the Dropbox folder in addition to in your Dropbox.\nFor OS X or Linux computers\nOpen your Terminal app located at /Applications/Utilities/Terminal. (Or, open your preferred command line input on Linux.)\nCopy and paste the command line below and press Enter on your keyboard.\nfind ~/Dropbox -type l -exec ls -lah {} \\;\nFor Windows computers\nPress the Windows + R keys (at the same time) on your keyboard.\nType cmd and press Enter on your keyboard to open the command prompt.\nCopy and paste the command line below and press Enter on your keyboard.\ndir \"%HOMEPATH%\\Dropbox\" /a:l /s\nBy default, the Dropbox folder is located in ~/Dropbox.

It is no longer available for purchase.\nBy default, Dropbox saves all deletion and version history of your files for 30 days (or longer, if you have a Dropbox Professional or Business account).\nIf you're a Dropbox Plus user, and you previously purchased EVH, you can recover a deleted file or revert to an older file version at any time within a year of a deletion or edit.\n:subtitle: Permanent deletions\nPermanently deleted files are not recoverable with EVH. Learn how to delete files, and what happens after you delete a file.\n:subtitle: Storage quota\nPrevious versions and deleted files do not count against your storage quota, with or without the EVH add-on.\n:subtitle: Shared folders and version history\nRemoving a shared folder from your Dropbox is not the same as deleting that folder. After you remove a shared folder from your Dropbox, EVH is no longer in effect for the content in that shared folder because the shared folder is no longer linked to your account. If you add the folder again within 30 days of removing a folder from your Dropbox, deletion and version history of files from before the folder was left are recoverable with EVH.\n:subtitle: Version history period\nDepending on your plan and if you purchased EVH, your version history is available for a specific length of time. We'll call this your \"version history period.\"\nIf you create a file, and then edit it after your version history period elapses, only this most recent, edited version of the file can be recovered.\nFor example, imagine that you have a file called myfile.docx, and that you have a 30 day version history period. If you created myfile.docx on January 1st, and then edited it on March 1st, only this version from March 1st is available in your account.\nThis is true because your version history period of 30 days elapsed between creation of the original version—January 1st—and the edited version—March 1st.\nThe March 1st version is available until you edit the file again and 30 days have elapsed since March 1st."},{"title":"File preview errors and other messages  Dropbox","body":":title: File preview errors and other messages – Dropbox\nThere are multiple reasons why a file may fail to preview on Dropbox. If you've encountered an error message while trying to preview a file, read on to find an explanation behind the message you're seeing. You'll also find a recommended solution.\n:subtitle: [file type] files can't be previewed\nProblem:\nIf you're seeing the error message [file type] files can't be previewed, it's because Dropbox doesn't recognize the file type. Dropbox supports an extensive list of file types for previews, but it appears your file is not on this list.\nSolution:\nIf you've encountered this error message, simply open or download the file to view it.\n:subtitle: This file is too big to preview\nProblem:\nIf you're seeing the error message This file is too big to preview, it's because Dropbox sets a limit on the size of files that can preview on dropbox.com. The file you're trying to preview exceeds this limit.\nConsider the following size limits for some common file types:\nAdobe Illustrator: 144 MB\nMicrosoft Word: 160 MB\nMicrosoft PowerPoint: 288 MB\nMicrosoft Excel: 40 MB\nPDF: 80 MB\nPhotoshop and .tiff: 200 MB\nText and code: 4 MB\nSolution:\nIf you've encountered this error message, simply open or download the file to view it.\n:subtitle: This file is password-protected\nProblem:\nIf you're seeing the error message This file is password-protected, it's because of a password conflict between Dropbox and the file application. Many applications (for example, Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop) allow you to set passwords for your files. Dropbox does not support this password, and those files that have it won’t preview.\nSolutions:\nIf you'd like to preview the file on dropbox.com, open the file in its original application and remove the password. If you'd like to password-protect your files, consider setting a password on the Dropbox shared link instead.\nIf you'd like to keep the password, simply open or download the file to view it.\nNote: With Dropbox Professional or Dropbox Business, you can set passwords and expiration dates for shared links. This is a way to password-protect files without setting a password in the app you used to create it.\n:subtitle: Files without extensions cannot be previewed\nProblem:\nIf you're seeing the error message Files without extensions cannot be previewed, it's because the file doesn't have a suffix attached to the file name. File suffixes (or \"extensions\") indicate the type of file, and help your computer know which application to use to open it. If you remove this extension, the file won't preview.\nExamples of file extensions include .xlsx, .mov, and .txt.\nSolution:\nIf you've encountered this error message, add the extension back to the file name and save it again.\n:subtitle: File is uploading\nProblem:\nIf you're seeing a message that says File is uploading, it's because the file hasn't finished syncing to Dropbox. A file must be fully uploaded and saved (or \"synced\") to Dropbox before it can be previewed.\nThis error message often occurs in the following two scenarios:\nYou copy a Dropbox link to a file directly from Finder or Windows Explorer, before sync is complete\nYou attempt to preview a screenshot\nSolution:\nWait for the syncing process to complete before trying to preview a file.\n:subtitle: This file cannot be previewed\nProblem:\nIf you're seeing the general error message This file cannot be previewed, there may be several possible reasons.\nSolutions:\nFirst, verify that your file hasn't been corrupted. To do this, try to open it with some other application on your desktop. If the file doesn't open with another desktop app, then it has likely been corrupted.\nNext, verify that the file has the correct extension. If an extension is incorrect, the file won't preview.\nOnce you've verified that the file isn't corrupted and has a valid extension, simply open or download the file to preview it."},{"title":"File privacy and visibility who can see your files  Dropbox","body":":title: File privacy and visibility: who can see your files – Dropbox\nAll of the files you store in Dropbox are private.

For example, if your account has a storage quota of 2 GB, you can upload one 2 GB file or many files that add up to 2 GB. If you are over your storage quota, Dropbox will stop syncing."},{"title":"File sync is slow or taking too long to complete  Dropbox","body":":title: File sync is slow, or taking too long to complete – Dropbox\n:subtitle: I'm connected to the Internet and signed in to the same account on my devices, but files aren't syncing—are there issues with the files?\nIf you're seeing an issue with a file, and you've already checked that your computers are connected to the Internet and are linked to the same Dropbox account, the file may have an issue that prevents Dropbox from syncing.\nOperating systems don't always play nicely with one another. The Dropbox desktop application tracks these inconsistencies and will try its best to resolve the problem gracefully. When it can't, the file will still sync to the website, but it may not appear or work properly on incompatible operating systems.\nTo see which of your files may cause syncing problems, log in to the Dropbox website and use the Dropbox bad files check tool.\n:subtitle: General File Type Guidelines\nTo ensure your files and folders sync correctly on other operating systems, try to follow these guidelines:\n:subtitle: Incompatible characters for all operating systems\nDon't name your files with the following characters, as Dropbox will not sync them on any platform:\n/ (forward slash)\n\\ (backslash)\n:subtitle: Incompatible characters with Windows\nWhen naming your files, avoid characters incompatible with the Windows file system:\n< (less than)\n> (greater than)\n: (colon)\n\" (double quote)\n| (vertical bar or pipe)\n? (question mark)\n* (asterisk)\n:subtitle: Ignored file types\nSome small system files aren't synced over Dropbox. These include:\ndesktop.ini\nthumbs.db\n.ds_store\nicon\\r\n.dropbox\n.dropbox.attr\n:subtitle: Max character length\nWindows only allows file and folder names of 260 characters or less. On top of this limit, certain applications—such as Microsoft Excel—have shorter limits (218 characters).\nNote that Windows counts the file path as part of the name, so the sample file path below would be 142 characters, not 16:\nC:\\Users\\Panda\\My Documents\\Dropbox\\Creative Nonfiction\\My Autobiography\\Favorite Things\\Favorite Foods\\Bamboo\\Family Recipes\\Fresh Leaves.doc\nVersions 3.0 and higher of the Dropbox desktop application are able to read and write to locations that are longer than 260 characters long without problems. However, some applications might still be subject to the Operating System limits and may have problems accessing files that are in long paths.\nFor example, if you have an Excel 2010 file in a path that is 260 characters long, Dropbox will sync it to your computer but when you try to open it Excel will show an error message like \"File Cannot be accessed\". You can read more about Office and Microsoft path limitations on their Help Center. In general, all you need to do to open those files is to shorten the name or move the file or folder to a higher-level folder.\n:subtitle: Case conflicts\nMost Linux installations allow you to have two files or folders with the same name but different capitalization. However, by default, Mac and Windows won't differentiate file or folder names by case. Therefore, if Dropbox comes across linux directories named \"Sample folder\" and \"sample folder\" (lowercase \"s\"), it will still sync both folders to Mac and Windows computers, but one will appear as a copy of the original file and appended with case conflict.\n:subtitle: Beginning characters on Mac and Linux\nFiles or folders that begin with a period (such as .myfile.doc or .myfolder) will sync properly and actually be in the Dropbox folder on your computer. However, Mac and Linux operating systems will regard them as system files and hide them automatically. You won’t be able to see them without modifying advanced settings on your computer. It's best to go to your Dropbox on the website and rename the files or folders to something else (such as _myfolder).\n:subtitle: Trailing characters\nFiles and folders that end with periods (.) won't sync properly between operating systems. If a file ends in a period, like file.txt., the file won't sync and it will appear in bad files check.\nTrailing spaces in file and folder names are stripped in order to sync properly with other operating systems. If Dropbox finds a file in your Dropbox folder with the same name but different only in white space (or the character created by pressing the space bar), it will add the file to your Dropbox folder and append the file name with white space conflict.\n:subtitle: Temporary files\nWhen some applications (such as Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint) open a file, they will often save a temporary file in the same directory and name it in one of the following ways:\nName begins with ~$ (a tilde and dollar sign) or .~ (a period and tilde)\nName begins with a tilde and ends in .tmp, such as ~myfile.tmp\nDropbox does not sync these temporary files on any operating system.\n:subtitle: Unicode encoding conflicts\nIn some instances, there are several ways to create the same character on your keyboard. Although the characters may look the same, they are not the same to operating systems and Dropbox. When Dropbox notices these encoding conflicts, it will create a conflicted copy of the file and save it in the same folder appended with Unicode Encoding Conflict.\n:subtitle: Metadata and resource forks\nAvoid syncing files that use metadata (or resource forks), including Mac aliases or Windows shortcuts. These types of files typically only work on the operating systems they were created on.\n:subtitle: Junction points and aliases\nDropbox will follow Windows junction points (Windows Vista or later) and sync the files or folders they link to. However, any changes to those files or folders made from the Windows operating system will not sync again until the Dropbox desktop application is restarted. To get around this, move the original folder to your Dropbox and add a junction point from its previous location to link to its new location in the Dropbox folder.\n:subtitle: A warning regarding metadata and FAT32 drives\nSome documents have file attributes, or xattrs, in data attached to the file. We call this data metadata. Operating systems use metadata for many different ways: storing the icon, labeling your documents, attaching information to the file, permissions, and so on. Dropbox supports xattrs on all platforms. However, thumb drives and portable drives that use the FAT32 file system do not support metadata. If your Dropbox folder is on a FAT32 drive, unfortunately it is impossible to retain metadata when the file is moved or renamed.\n:subtitle: Monitoring more than 10000 folders on Linux\nThe Linux version of the Dropbox desktop application is limited from monitoring more than 10000 folders by default. Anything over that is not watched and, therefore, ignored when syncing. There's an easy fix for this. Open a terminal and enter the following:\necho fs.inotify.max_user_watches=100000 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf; sudo sysctl -p\nThis command will tell your system to watch up to 100000 folders. Once the command is entered and you enter your password, Dropbox will immediately resume syncing.\n:subtitle: Turning on extended attribute (xattr) support in Linux\nSome Linux distributions have extended attributes (xattrs) turned off by default. If you're running a Linux distribution with an ext3 or ext4 file system, it's possible to turn on xattr support, typically through your /etc/fstab settings file. Please refer to your Linux distribution's documentation for instructions."},{"title":"File types that are viewable on a phone or tablet  Dropbox","body":":title: File types that are viewable on a phone or tablet – Dropbox\n:subtitle: Previewing files in the Dropbox app\nThe Dropbox Android app automatically previews the following types of files:\nAdobe files:\nPDF (.pdf)\nIllustrator (.ai, .eps)\nPhotoshop (.psd)\nImages (.bmp, gif, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .tif, .tiff, .svg)\nMicrosoft files\nMicrosoft Word documents (.doc, .docx)\nMicrosoft PowerPoint presentations (.ppt, .pptx, .pptm, .pps, .ppsm, .ppsx)\nMicrosoft Excel spreadsheets (.xls, .xlsx)\nRaw images (.cr2, .crw, .nef, .nrw, .sr2, .dng, .arw, .orf)\nText files (.txt, .csv, .rtf, .odt, .md)\nVideos (.3gp, .3gpp, .3gpp2, .asf, .avi, .dv, .m2t, .m4v, .mkv, .mov, .mp4, .mpeg, .mpg, .mts, .oggtheora, .ogv, .rm, .ts, .vob, .webm, .wmv, .flv)\nNote: You may see a pop-up notification above the preview.

You can also temporarily disable this software. Once synced, you should no longer see these warnings or quarantine messages.\nNote: Unlike other folders in Dropbox, the \".dropbox.cache\" folder should have a red X on it—this folder does not need to sync.\nIf you've verified that antivirus or security software is not interfering with your sync process, move on to step 13.\nVerify that you're not trying to sync too many files.\nThe performance of the Dropbox application can decline if you have more than 300,000 files. This is a soft limit and depends highly on the hardware specifications of the computer running the Dropbox application. Some customers are able to have more files without issue. As a hard rule, we recommend never having more than 1 million files on any single computer. This limit is related to the number of files, not to their size.\nNote: Dropbox accounts with a large number of files may take longer to sync. A delay in syncing or a prolonged sync is not necessarily a sign of a problem.\nFix: You can use Selective Sync to select only certain files to sync to your computer, but still have them on dropbox.com and on other computers.\nFix: You may be able to help Dropbox sync faster by adjusting your bandwidth settings.\nIf you've tried each of the fixes in this article, and still find that your files or devices still aren't syncing, please contact us.

Why doesn't Dropbox look right? – Dropbox\nThere can be a few possible causes of missing or corrupted files. The fastest way for us to assist with missing files is for you to carefully read this article.\nNote: Often \"missing\" files aren't missing at all—they've just been moved. Dropbox usually logs the move of a file as both a deletion (from its original location) and an addition (to its new location).\nIf you move or rename files, you may receive a Deleted files notification. However, you may miss the notification that the files were added elsewhere. If you (or a shared-folder member) moved your \"missing\" files, you can simply begin accessing them again in the new location. No recovery is needed.\nIf your files are missing, or something else is wrong, select from the Sections in this article below. You'll then learn what to do next.\n:subtitle: I can't find a file or folder, but I don't think I deleted it\nThere can be several reasons why a file or folder might go missing. If the file was in a shared folder, another member of the folder may have accidentally deleted it. Or it may have simply gotten moved to another folder in your Dropbox.\nWhatever the reason, Dropbox keeps a log of everything that happens in your account, and you can use this log both to find out what happened and to recover missing files. There are a couple of ways to investigate:\nUse the search bar:\nSign in to dropbox.com.\nNavigate to dropbox.com/events.\nScan the page, looking for any deletions that might relate to the missing file or folder. These actions include additions, edits, deletions, renames, or moves.\nIf your file was renamed or moved, you will be able to see the new file name or its new location\nIf your file was deleted, hover the mouse pointer over the file listing, and click the Restore button that appears on the right\nNot seeing the Restore button? Follow these steps to get help restoring your files\nNote: Restorations can take time if there are a large number of files to restore\n:subtitle: :subtitle: I'm not finding my missing file using any of the methods above—what should I do?\nIf you're not finding any record of a moved, renamed, or deleted file, consider these other possibilities:\nWas your missing file in a shared folder? Did you leave or unshare this shared folder?\nDid the deletion event occur more than 30 days ago? Are you a Dropbox Basic user, or a Dropbox Plus customer who has not also purchased extended version history?\nI'm still having trouble. Take me back to the top of the article so I can start over.\n:subtitle: I—or somebody I share folders with—deleted something, and I want it back\nIf you know for a fact that you deleted a file—or that someone you share a folder with deleted it—you can do a couple of things to get it back. You'll know that you or a shared-folder member deleted a file if:\nYou received an email notifying you of a large number of deletions from your Dropbox account\nYou've already visited the events page and found a listing for your missing file or folder\nYou recall deleting the file or folder, or a shared-folder member told you they deleted it\nTo restore deleted files, you can search inside the folder that you know the file was deleted from using the search bar, the Events page, or the Deleted Files page. By limiting the search you can more quickly find what occurred in your specific shared folder.\nUse the search bar:\nSign in to dropbox.com.\nClick the Search bar at the top of the page, and enter some keywords that apply to your missing file or folder.\nScroll to the bottom of the search results page—deleted files will appear here.\nLocate the log entry for the deletion of your file or folder, and hover the mouse pointer over this entry. Click the Restore button that appears to the right.\nNot seeing the Restore button? Follow these steps to get help restoring your files.\nNote: Restorations can take time if there are a large number of files to restore\nNot finding your missing files? Try using the Events page.\nUse the Events page:\nSign in to dropbox.com.\nNavigate to dropbox.com/events.\nIf the event you're looking for occurred in a shared folder, click the All dropdown and select the shared folder you'd like to roll back\nIf the event you're looking for did not occur in a shared folder, scan for the event where the files you want to recover were deleted, click … (ellipsis icon), and then click Restore.\nScroll through the page, looking for any deletions that might relate to the missing file or folder.\nNot finding your missing files? Try using the Deleted Files page.\nUse the Deleted Files page:\nSign in to dropbox.com.\nClick Deleted Files in the left sidebar.\nIf the event you're looking for occurred in a shared folder, click the All dropdown and select the shared folder you'd like to roll back\nIf the event you're looking for did not occur in a shared folder, scan for the event where the files you want to recover were deleted, click … (ellipsis icon), and then click Restore\nScroll through the page, looking for any deletions that might relate to the missing file or folder.\nI'm not finding my missing file using any of the methods above—what should I do?\nIf you're not finding any record of a moved, renamed, or deleted file, consider these other possibilities:\nDid the deletion event occur more than 30 days ago? Are you a Dropbox Basic user, or a Dropbox Plus customer who has not also purchased Extended version history?\nIf you've tried each of the methods to restore a file from a shared folder and you're still having trouble, follow these steps\nI'm still having trouble, and my issue isn't related to a shared folder. Take me back to the top of the article so I can start over.\n:subtitle: My Dropbox is a mess, and I want to revert all or part of it back in time\nIf there are too many issues with the files in your Dropbox, you can roll your entire account, or certain shared folders, back to a specific moment. You can think of this rollback as a kind of time machine: once finished, your entire Dropbox—or a specific shared folder in it—will look exactly as it was before the issues began.\nTo do this, you'll need to work with a Dropbox support agent. But first, you'll save a lot of time by carefully reading the section below, and providing exactly the requested info in your support ticket.\nProvide a Dropbox support agent with the needed info to perform an account rollback:\nWhen we perform a rollback, you will have several options. You can choose to revert:\nOne shared folder\nMultiple shared folders\nFiles that are not shared\nYour entire Dropbox account\nWhichever option you choose, performing a rollback means that your account—or the selected shared folder(s)—will be reverted to the exact state it was in prior to the deletion event. Any changes made after that point will be overwritten. It may be useful to make a copy outside of your Dropbox of any files you have recently edited so that you don't lose important changes.\nOnce you have made copies of any recently edited files, you'll need to get in touch with Dropbox support and provide an event link.\nI'm still having trouble, and my issue isn't related to an account rollback. Take me back to the top of the article so I can start over.\n:subtitle: My Dropbox files have been encrypted by a virus malware\nIf a virus or malware infects one of the devices you have connected to your Dropbox, it may also infect the files in your Dropbox. Specifically, the virus may encrypt your files, making them inaccessible. This can be scary, but we're usually able to help in these cases.\nIf your Dropbox files have been encrypted due to a virus or malware, your Dropbox account—and any infected shared folders—will likely need to be rolled back to a specific point in time before the encryption happened. This is the best way to fix all encrypted files. A Dropbox support agent can help with this, but you'll first need to do one very important thing:\nHave the malware removed from your computer, so that restored files aren't encrypted again after the rollback\nOnce you have had your device cleaned of the virus or malware, follow these steps to assist a support agent in performing a rollback.\nNote: Unsharing shared folders, or unlinking devices from the Dropbox desktop application, can further complicate this process. Please do not take either of these actions. If you already have, let the Dropbox support agent you're working with know.\nI'm still having trouble, and my issue isn't related to a virus malware. Take me back to the top of the article so I can start over.\n:subtitle: A bunch of old files suddenly reappeared\nThough rare, occasionally old or deleted files will reappear in your Dropbox. If this is the case, we can roll back your account to the point before this event occurred, or undo the individual addition events.\nI'm still having trouble, and my issue isn't related to reappearing files. Take me back to the top of the article so I can start over.\n:subtitle: I use Dropbox on a Samsung device, and I'm seeing lots of deletions\nSamsung created a deep Dropbox integration for their devices that allows access to all documents in your Dropbox account from a special DocumentSync folder on your phone. This DocumentSync feature allows you to add, edit, and delete any files that appear in this folder, and these modifications will show up both on your phone and in Dropbox.\nIf you use Dropbox on a Samsung device, and you see a large number of individual file deletion events, it is possible that this DocumentSync feature is the cause. While Dropbox did not build DocumentSync, we can help you restore files to your Dropbox if you encounter issues with this feature.\nRestore files deleted due to DocumentSync:\nSign in to dropbox.com.\nNavigate to dropbox.com/events.\nNote the earliest date you first saw these deletions (the \"beginning\" date), and the last date you saw these deletions (the \"ending\" date).\nGo to the Dropbox support page, and follow this path to email us the deletion dates: File recovery, Undo a large number of changes to files and folders, Undo a large number of changes.\nIn your support ticket, please provide the \"beginning\" and \"ending\" dates of the deletions, as well as a written okay for our support agent to perform a restoration on your behalf\nDisable DocumentSync:\nIf you continue to have trouble with DocumentSync, you can temporarily or permanently disable it. DocumentSync is different from the Dropbox application on your phone, so disabling the feature will not impact the Dropbox app performance in any way.\nLearn how to disable DocumentSync\n:subtitle: A final note on restoring missing files and folders\nIf you have tried some or all of the above methods and still are not able to restore missing files or folders, you can try contacting us. However, please note that the vast majority of issues with missing files are explained in one of the five scenarios discussed in this article. And, as we said at the start, in each case some action is required on the part of you—the Dropbox customer—to complete the recovery. Following one of the detailed instruction sets above will save you time and get you to the best—and fastest—resolution possible.\n:subtitle: Why did my files go missing—did Dropbox do this?\nThere are various reasons why files can go missing, as detailed in the troubleshooting sections above. However, it's important to note that Dropbox will not delete or remove your files on its own. Even if you go over your storage limit, nothing is deleted. In this case syncing simply stops, and will resume once you bring your account back under its storage limit.\nThe application monitors changes that occur in your Dropbox and syncs any edits, additions, or deletions. If a file isn't where you expect it to be, please know that Dropbox will never add, edit, move, or delete files on its own. The vast majority of the time, missing files are due to one of the following:\nPurposeful or accidental file or folder deletions\nPurposeful or accidental file moves or renames\nEvents on a linked computer, mobile device, or on dropbox.com\nEvents in a shared folder, or the removal of a shared folder\nEvents in a team folder\nEvents an admin of a Dropbox Business or Dropbox Enterprise team took on your behalf\nThat said, there are a few other causes of deleted or missing files:\nHard disk problems, including bad disks, or disks that are not ready when the Dropbox program runs. If Dropbox doesn't see known files when it starts, it will assume you removed them while Dropbox wasn't running.\nAntivirus software that quarantines files. These programs can remove or block access to files.\nDisk scanning software (for example, backup software) that locks out Dropbox and makes it appear as if files are missing.\nPrograms that modify files in your Home folder, which usually includes the Dropbox folder. Some audio and image management software programs do this.\nMultiple linked computers with the same name. Perhaps you gave your PC to someone else to use, and they deleted some files. If this PC has the same name as your new computer, you might not realize a second PC is in the picture. If the computer is linked to your account, then you can see the last used IP address for it on your Security page.\nLearn how to recover older versions of a file.\nI received an email about an inactive Dropbox account—what do I need to do?"},{"title":"Find the admin on a Dropbox Business team  Dropbox","body":":title: Find the admin on a Dropbox Business team – Dropbox\nAn admin is a member of a Dropbox Business account, and is typically also a member of your company.

If a group and individual's permissions are ever different, the user will always have the permissions that grant them the highest level of file and folder access.\n:subtitle: What happens to permissions if a user is listed more than once in a group?\nIf users are listed in a shared folder more than once due to their group memberships, those users will default to the permissions that grant them additional functionality. For example, if the group is granted edit permissions but a user invited individually to that group has view-only permissions, then the group member will actually have the additional edit permissions granted to the group.\nTo limit a group member's access, first remove them from the group and then invite them as an individual shared folder member with \"can view\" access. Or, invite each member individually to set distinct view or edit permissions for each member."},{"title":"Hackpad is migrating to Dropbox Paper  Dropbox","body":":title: Hackpad is migrating to Dropbox Paper – Dropbox\nOn July 19, 2017, Hackpad began to shut down. We're importing Hackpad pads into Paper over the next few months. Once the imports are complete, Hackpad will shut down.\nDropbox acquired Hackpad in 2014, and the code was open-sourced in April 2015. Since we acquired Hackpad, we've been building on Hackpad to create :subtitle: Dropbox Paper.\nWhat happens to my Hackpad pads?\nIf you're a Hackpad user, you can manually import all your pads to Paper. All your Hackpad data will be accessible within Paper.\nIf you don't manually import your pads or opt out, we'll automatically import your pads for you in the coming months. Once we begin automatically importing your pads into Paper, your Hackpad becomes read-only. We'll send you an email once the auto-import is complete. You can then join your workspaces and access your pads in Paper.\nNote: If your admin opted your team out of importing pads, your pads won't be auto-imported into Paper, and will be deleted.\nDropbox Paper\nPaper is a live collaboration application where you can work with your team to create docs, presentations, and much more. You can use Paper with a free Dropbox Basic account, a free team, or a Dropbox Business team.\nLearn more about Dropbox Paper.\n:subtitle: Move your Hackpad pads to Paper\nIt's easy to move all your Hackpad work into Paper. You can continue working with your team through Paper docs.\nThere are two parts of moving your pads to Paper: importing and joining. If we auto-import your pads, you'll still need to join them.\nImporting: Only an admin of a workspace can import pads. Importing transfers your pads to Paper and makes them into Paper docs. After you import a workspace, all pads from the workspace are available in Paper. If you don't belong to a workspace, you can import personal pads.\nJoining: After a workspace is imported, other members of the team can gain access by joining the workspace. When you join a workspace, you can access all content from that workspace in Paper.\n:subtitle: Import your pads to Paper\nIf you're the admin of a workspace, you can import that workspace into Paper. Your workspace becomes a shared folder in Paper. If your pads are in your personal workspace, you can import them.\nSign in to dropbox.com with the account you want to import your Hackpad work to.\nIf you don't have a Dropbox account, create one to move your work to Paper.\nGo to paper.dropbox.com/hackpad.\nEnter the email address for your Hackpad account.\nClick the link in the confirmation email you receive.\nYou'll see a list of workspaces you can import and the pads or folders that you can join. To import a workspace, click Import next to the workspace you're interested in.\nOnce the workspace is imported, it will appear under Previously imported. You can't import the same workspace twice.\nWhat happens to my pads once I move them to Paper?\nAs an admin, you automatically join the workspace with your Dropbox account. A folder called \"[Your team name] (Hackpad Import)\" will be created in Paper for any team workspaces. You won't have access to the private pads that your team members had in this workspace.\nYour private pads will be added directly to your Paper account. The private pads of your team members are also imported, but remain private to those team members. Your team members will need to join their private docs to access them in Paper.\nNote: If you're not an admin of your Hackpad team, you need to join your workspaces in order to access them in Paper.\nDo I need to be a part of a Dropbox team to use Paper?\nIf you aren't a member of a Dropbox Business team or free team, you can work with your team by sharing docs. However, working on a Dropbox team makes it easier to share and collaborate. If you're on a Dropbox Business team, the admins of your team can administrate and manage Paper docs.\nLearn more about Paper admin controls of Dropbox Business teams.\nThe import completed, but some of my pads weren't imported. What can I do?\nIt's possible that some pads can't be imported to Paper. Any pads we couldn't import are listed in the email you receive after the import completes.\nIf your pads were auto-imported and the import failed, we'll send you a zip file containing HTML of all your pads.\n:subtitle: Join your pads\nOnce your pads are imported, you can join your pads:\nSign in to dropbox.com with the account you want to import your Hackpad work to.\nIf you don't have a Dropbox account, create one to move your work to Paper.\nGo to paper.dropbox.com/hackpad.\nEnter your Hackpad email address.\nClick the link in the confirmation email you receive.\nYou'll see a list of the pads or folders that you can join. Click Join next to the pads or folders you want to import to Paper.\nWhat happens if someone goes to my Hackpad pad after I import my workspace to Paper?\nAfter the import is complete, anyone who visits your Hackpad pad is automatically redirected to the corresponding Paper doc.\nWhat happens to my public workspaces when I move my work to Paper?\nPaper doesn't support public workspaces. However, you can still share your work with whoever you’d like.\nIf you import your docs to Paper, people who had access to the workspace in Hackpad can join the workspace and access the docs in Paper.\nYou can also set a doc to the most open sharing setting in Paper: People with the link can edit. Anyone with the link to the doc and a Dropbox account can collaborate with you.\nI don't have a Dropbox account. Can I still import my pads?\nIf you don't have a Dropbox account yet, you need to create one before you import your pads. Use your Dropbox account to sign in to Paper.\nWhat happens if I can't contact the admin of my workspace?\nAll pads will be moved to Paper after July 19, 2017. You can join your pads once they have been imported to Paper.\nIf you can't contact the admin of your workspace, contact Dropbox Support for help."},{"title":"Help center  Dropbox","body":":title: Help center – Dropbox\nPaper helps teams collaborate in real-time.

Dropbox user accounts must remain signed in on a machine for files to sync properly.\nWe recommend that only one user account accesses a given Dropbox folder, and that this folder is located on the main drive of your computer or on a drive that is physically connected to the computer.\nDropbox Support may not be able to assist with problems that occur when running the Dropbox app on a server OS.\nLearn more about supported operating systems.\n:subtitle: Can Dropbox be shared locally on our network from our server?\nSome teams attempt to share a single Dropbox folder over local network sharing so that multiple people can access the same Dropbox account. We don't recommend sharing the Dropbox folder, or any folders inside the Dropbox folder, over your local network.\nIf you share a Dropbox folder over your network, issues can occur because network file systems do not send messages when files change. Dropbox waits for these ‘file update events’ to sync changes. If you attempt to share a single Dropbox folder over a server, the following issues can occur:\nPermission issues\nFiles stuck in sync\nExtended sync times\n:subtitle: How can I make sure that my files stay on my server for backup purposes?\nSome teams want to keep a copy of their files on a local server, in addition to in Dropbox, for secondary backup and to access files offline.\nBy default, all of the files you put in Dropbox are synced online and remain on your local hard drive (unless you decide to use selective sync). This means that you can access your files from your local drive even if you're offline. Once uploaded to Dropbox, your files and any subsequent edits to your files are backed up as long as the application is running. The time frame for recovering edits and deleted files depends on the account type.

Schedule the migration for overnight, on a weekend, or when your team is less likely to need access to these files.\nMake sure that your computer has enough space. Keep in mind that Dropbox keeps a copy of your files on your local hard drive by default.\nNote: If your data is on an external drive connected to the server, you can move the Dropbox folder to the same external drive. You can also free up space on your local hard drive after migration with selective sync.\n:subtitle: Migrating your data\nInstall Dropbox on your server computer. Make sure you're accessing the server directly and are not logging in remotely.\nSign in to the Dropbox desktop application with your Dropbox Business admin account credentials. An empty Dropbox folder will appear on the main drive of your computer.\nIf your data is on a physically connected external drive and you do not have sufficient space on your internal drive, you can either:\nIn the Dropbox folder, you can start setting up your folders.\nFrom the server computer, copy or move the folders that you would like to sync to Dropbox into the new folders you created.\nNote: Make sure that you are continuously logged in to the server computer until the migration is complete. Don't log out, change settings, or power off the computer during the migration process. The desktop application only syncs when you're logged in. You can check the sync status at any time using the desktop application.\n:subtitle: After migration\nInvite users to the shared folders they need. Once your team installs the Dropbox application and signs in, a copy of all the folders you shared will sync to their Dropbox folder. They can open these files just like any other file on their computer. Any changes that a team member makes to files will sync to Dropbox and any other members of the shared folder.\nSet shared folder permissions for your users. You can allow your team members to edit or view files in a shared folder.\nUnlink you account from the server computer if you are done with the initial transfer and do not want to continue using Dropbox on this computer.\nNote: If you choose to continue running Dropbox on this computer, only share folders in this Dropbox folder through the Dropbox application. Using server functionality to share folders within the Dropbox folder through the local network can cause various syncing issues and is not supported.\n:subtitle: FAQs\n:subtitle: How can I sync my data to Dropbox as fast as possible?\nMigration speed depends on your internet connection and bandwidth. We recommend that you start the migration process in the evening, or before a weekend, so your team’s work isn’t interrupted.\nIf you want to sync data more quickly, you can always increase your bandwidth settings, which allows Dropbox to take up more of your internet bandwidth.\nImportant: Migrations can take time. File syncing is a complex process that involves several steps behind the scenes:\nEach file is first hashed and compressed. It's then transferred, encrypted, and stored on our servers.\nThe Dropbox sync status displays an aggregate kB/s speed that includes these different steps.\nOnce your files have been transferred to our servers, any updates or changes to the files sync much faster since we only sync the changes.\n:subtitle: What can I do during migration? Can I work on files immediately after they sync to Dropbox?\nEvery business works a little differently. Some teams find that it makes sense to migrate archived files first. For others, it makes more sense to start with active files. Either way, we recommend that you move your files in batches. When one batch of files finishes uploading, begin another batch.\nImportant:\nAvoid editing any files in folders that are still being synced to Dropbox or a team member’s computer.\nAt times, Dropbox is unable to sync files that are open in certain applications. If a file is open in another application, close the application and Dropbox will resume sync.\nWhen a folder shows a green circle with a check mark for all team members you can safely collaborate within that folder.\n:subtitle: Can I replicate my server file structure in Dropbox Business?\nIf you have a large amount of data, we recommend that you set up a file structure in your Dropbox Business account first. Use blank folders and labels as placeholders for your data. After sharing these empty folders with your team, you can start moving data into the folders.\nNote: Dropbox doesn't allow you to share a folder that's contained in another shared folder. For more tips on setting up a folder structure, visit this article.\n:subtitle: What if I don't have enough space on my local hard drive to sync to Dropbox?\nIf you don't have enough space on your local hard drive, you have two options:\nUse selective sync:\nMove folders in batches.\nWait for folders to sync to Dropbox and show a green check mark.\nApply selective sync to select folders.\nRepeat this process until you have synced all your files to Dropbox.\nUse Dropbox with an external drive.\nIf the Dropbox application has already been installed and has created a Dropbox folder on the main drive, use the steps in this article.\nIf you are installing Dropbox for the first time, select Advanced Options and set the location of the Dropbox folder as your external drive.\nOnce Dropbox creates a folder on your external drive, drag and drop your folders into it.\nConsider these suggestions for creating a file structure. Since you are moving the files from one folder to another on the same drive, the contents of the folder will not take up any additional space on either your main drive or this external drive.\nImportant:\nWhen the Dropbox folder is on a external drive, the external drive should be physically connected anytime Dropbox is running. The drive also must be properly formatted for the operating system of the connected device. You can view the system requirements for supported configurations and file systems.\nThe Dropbox folder should not be installed on a Network Attached Storage (NAS) drive.\nWe strongly recommend against methods that add referenced files (symlinks, junction points, or networked folders) to the Dropbox folder. Using reference files causes high CPU usage, poor syncing performance, permissions issues, and quota usage disparities."},{"title":"How do I redeem the Dropbox promotion that comes with my device  Dropbox","body":":title: How do I redeem the Dropbox promotion that comes with my device? – Dropbox\nDropbox has many partnerships with device manufacturers and service providers that give promotional space for a period of time.

Contact your admin to find out whether this feature has been turned on. If so, enter your email address and leave the password field blank on Dropbox's sign-in pages, and learn more about what you need to do to access Dropbox on the web, computers, and mobile devices. Also make sure that the email address for your Dropbox account matches the one you use for your company's sign-in page.\nHave you forgotten your password? If so, you can reset it yourself.

Will this count against my storage space? – Dropbox\nThe size of a shared folder will be counted against the quota of every member of that folder, unless each person is on the same Dropbox Business team. For Business teams, the size of the shared folder only counts once against the team's shared quota.\nFor all other users, your Dropbox storage quota is calculated by adding up the total amount of data in your Dropbox folder, including all shared folders and files collected from file requests. As a result, the owner of a Dropbox Basic 18 GB (2 GB + bonus storage earned through referrals) account will not be able to collaborate on a shared folder larger than 18 GB. One reason this policy exists is to prevent people from giving themselves unlimited space by stacking Basic accounts with shared folders.\nIf you need more space, consider upgrading to Dropbox Plus or Professional.\nDropbox Business is designed for projects, groups, and other organizations that want to share the same Dropbox storage quota with all of their members.\nIf you're on a Dropbox Business team and you share a folder with someone else on your team, the shared folder uses only the team's aggregate storage quota. However, if you share a folder with someone not included in your team, the folder uses both your team's space and space on the account of the person you shared with.\nLearn more about Dropbox Business."},{"title":"Im not prompted to enter my twostep verification code when I sign in Why not  Dropbox","body":":title: I'm not prompted to enter my two-step verification code when I sign in.

This can happen, for example, if your admin's sharing permissions don't allow folders to be shared outside the team, and you move a shared folder from your work Dropbox to your personal Dropbox. For this reason, you should always check with both your admin and the folder owner to see if they've set any restrictions before moving a shared folder to your other Dropbox.\nIf you're the owner of a shared folder in your work Dropbox, and you want to move it to your personal Dropbox, take a look at the folder's settings:\nSign in to dropbox.com.\nClick Sharing.\nUnder Folders in your Dropbox, click Share beside the shared folder.\nClick Folder settings.\nLook at the setting for Who can be invited?

Some USB drives, for example, take some time to mount before your computer recognizes them. The Dropbox desktop app could start before such a drive is ready and get confused. You'll receive an error and Dropbox will give you the opportunity to relink your Dropbox account or exit if it is unable to find your Dropbox folder.\nIf the external drive is disconnected from the computer while Dropbox is running, there's a small chance that the app will start deleting files before realizing that the entire drive has been removed.

The methods they use can be simple or sophisticated, which means you need to be careful about what you click or where you enter your email and passwords. Two of the most common methods to watch out for are phishing and malware.\n:subtitle: What phishing looks like\nPhishing is an attempt to trick you into providing sensitive information by pretending to be a person or service you trust (such as Dropbox or your bank). Examples of phishing attacks include:\nEmails that ask you to reply with your username/email and password\nEmails with links to fake login or password reset pages\nEmails with links to view or download a file from someone you don’t know\nEmails that mention a current event, entice you with a prize or deal, or pretend that there’s an urgent reason for you to respond or click on a link\nLinks on social network posts or comments that lead to fake login or password reset pages\nTargeted attacks that appear like they’re from someone you know or include personal information to get you to respond or click a link\n:subtitle: What malware looks like\nMalware is any malicious software that attackers try to get you to install so that they can steal your information or do harm to your files and computer.\nThere are many types of malware, including keystroke loggers, spyware, ransomware, scareware, adware, trojan horses, and worms. Some sneaky malware can be installed just by visiting a website, viewing an email message, or clicking a pop-up window.\nUnfortunately, because Dropbox is a trusted service, attackers will try to impersonate Dropbox with fake emails and websites. They may even try to use Dropbox itself to host a fake Dropbox site. Likewise, some attackers try to use Dropbox to host malware and send out shared links to it. See below for tips on how to stay safe.\n:subtitle: Tips to stay protected from phishing and malware\nBe careful about what you click, download, or install. Take a moment to check for warning signs and assess the risks before downloading a file or clicking a link.\nIf you don’t trust a link in an email, go directly to the normal login or home page for a service (for example, typing www.dropbox.com in the URL bar yourself). Contact the service or person you trust directly to verify that the message or link really came from them.\nUse strong passwords and choose a different password for each service that you use.\nUse two-step verification for Dropbox and other services that support it. Two-step verification protects your account even if your password falls into the wrong hands.\nEnable browser security and privacy settings to block phishing, malware, and other malicious sites in Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox or your favorite browser.\nInstall the latest updates for operating systems, browsers, software, and applications as soon as they become available, as they may have important security updates.\nUse anti-virus or other security tools to protect your devices.\nIf you use the Dropbox mobile app on your smartphone or tablet, set a passcode that will be required every time the app is launched.\nFollow good security practices to protect your entire computer. It's a good idea to require a password to log in to your account and to resume from sleep, screensavers, and lock screens.\nReport any suspicious items that appear to be from Dropbox or hosted on Dropbox by contacting us (see below for instructions). If you come across a phishing attempt that impersonates other services, contact the service or use the reporting feature in the app or website. You can also report malicious links to Safebrowsing or Internet Explorer for browser blocking. When you report something suspicious you’ll be protecting yourself and others.\n:subtitle: How to tell if an email is from Dropbox\nBe careful if you receive an email that claims to be from Dropbox but does not come from an official Dropbox domain (such as dropbox.com or dropboxmail.com). Email from a domain that's not on the official list may contain malware or be a phishing attempt.\nTo find out the domain an email came from, display the full headers of the message and look at the email address in the From field. Here are instructions for displaying the full headers in three of the most common email apps:\n:subtitle: Gmail\nWhile viewing the message, click the down arrow next to the Reply button and select Show Original from the menu.\n:subtitle: Yahoo Mail\nWhile viewing the message, click the Full headers link in the lower-right corner of the message.\n:subtitle: Microsoft Outlook\nOn Windows: Double-click the message to open it in a new window. Select the File tab and click Properties.\nOn Mac: Right-click (or Ctrl-click) the message and select View Source from the pop-up menu.\nOn the web: Double-click the message to open it in a new window. Click the Message Details icon (an envelope with a small document over it).\nIf you're using a different email app or the instructions above don't match what you see, check the app's help pages.\n:subtitle: How to tell you're on an official, trusted Dropbox web page\nOfficial Dropbox content will appear on any of our verified Dropbox domains.\n:subtitle: How to stay safe with user-hosted content on Dropbox\nDropbox has a list of paths that are used to host content for users when they create links to their files and folders. Dropbox does not use these paths to ask you for private or personal information.\nIf you're not sure whether the link is from a person you trust, or if you're not sure whether the link goes to a regular, non-malicious file or folder, don't click on the link or download the file. Instead, contact the trusted person and ask if they sent you something. Or contact us (see below for instructions) and we'll investigate the link for you.\n:subtitle: How to report something suspicious\nContact us at abuse@dropbox.com. We'll analyze what you've provided and take immediate action if we find a violation of the Dropbox Acceptable Use Policy, such as phishing, malware, or spam.\n:subtitle: If you received an email\nForward the complete email to abuse@dropbox.com. Sending a screenshot or copying and pasting the message from the email won't provide as much information as the email itself. Please just forward the entire thing to us.\n:subtitle: If you received or came across a shared link\nSend an email to abuse@dropbox.com and include the following:\nA description of how you received or found the link\nThe full URL of the link. It will look something like these examples:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/aae4bc8tiqfajiv/Documents.zip?dl=1&token_hash=AAEypH2T8PyYqgLbfYkQYCh84_yqgMFTQWgXYgsT8eWsxA&expiry=140078586\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/89498758/FriendlyClient/Shop/setup.exe\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/s/n4rhqk0s87urp17/Report.zip?dl=1&token_hash=AAGjTBQh7cxJrJ2-Yud9Jy-ToE3YzAk63D1vTevtPVEkXg&expiry=1400822689\n:subtitle: What to do if you've been tricked\nIf you've clicked a suspicious link or entered information in a suspicious place, take steps to make your Dropbox account as secure as possible:\nChange your Dropbox account password, which you can do by going to the security page for your account (www.dropbox.com/account/security). Dropbox recommends strong passwords that are not used for any other website or service.\nChange the password to the email address you use for your Dropbox account. Again, choose a strong password that you don't use for any other service (including Dropbox).\nEnable two-step verification, which protects your account even if your password is compromised. Once enabled, Dropbox will require a six-digit code in addition to your password when signing in to the Dropbox website or linking a new device.\nReview the latest apps and devices linked to your account (www.dropbox.com/account/security) and unlink anything that looks unfamiliar to you by clicking the \"X\" beside it.\nReview your list of shared folders (www.dropbox.com/share) to make sure that the right folders are being shared and with the right people. Unshare any folders that you own but don't want shared.\nReview any links to files in your account (www.dropbox.com/links). Disable any links you don't want to be active anymore.\nIf you're still worried about your Dropbox account, contact us and we'll do whatever we can to help.\n:subtitle: Related articles\nDoes Dropbox offer phone tech support?"},{"title":"Protecting yourself if you find a device you dont recognize linked to your account  Dropbox","body":":title: Protecting yourself if you find a device you don't recognize linked to your account – Dropbox\nA password is always necessary to connect a device to a Dropbox account. If you see a device you don't recognize, it's possible you signed in to your Dropbox account on a new device and authorized it by mistake. It's possible that someone has access to your email and password account. This can happen if you ever shared your email and password with other people.\nFirst, make sure you secure your email account. Then secure your Dropbox account by following the steps in this article.\n:subtitle: Find out the location of a device that's linked to your Dropbox\nDropbox logs the IP address of each device that accesses your account.

Be sure to use a strong password that you don't use for any other service. When hackers obtain sensitive information from one service, they use it to access accounts at other services. This is made possible by the fact that many people use the same password across multiple services.\nChange the password to the email account that you use for your Dropbox account.\nUnlink any other unfamiliar devices, web sessions, and apps linked to your account by going to your security page.\nSet up two-step verification, which can protect your account even if your password is compromised.\nNote: The Dropbox folder is just a normal folder on your computer, so it's no more or less secure than every other folder on your computer. We recommend that you follow good security practices to protect your entire computer. This includes requiring a password to log in to your account, and to resume from sleep, screen savers and lock screens."},{"title":"Recover deleted users on a Dropbox Business team  Dropbox","body":":title: Recover deleted users on a Dropbox Business team – Dropbox\nIf a Dropbox Business admin has accidentally deleted a team member, they have seven days to restore the user.

Selective sync gives you the control to ensure you have only the files you need on any computer.\n:subtitle: What happens if my hard drive doesn't have enough space to sync all of my files?\nWhen you save a file to Dropbox, it syncs with all of the devices you've connected with your Dropbox account. This means that it takes up space on each computer hard drive. This can create problems if your hard drive doesn't have enough available space to sync everything in your Dropbox folder.\nIf your hard drive is full, you don't necessarily need to delete files. If you have enough Dropbox space, you can instead use selective sync. See the instructions above for using selective sync.\n:subtitle: Smart Sync\nIf you're a Dropbox Business user, you have two ways to manage what syncs to your desktop application:\nSelective sync. Selective sync helps you choose which files appear in your file explorer, and which are only available on dropbox.com.\nSmart Sync. Smart Sync shows you all of your content in your file explorer, but only downloads the ones that you want to access locally.\nYou can use both features together, or choose just one.\nLearn more about Smart Sync.\nIf you're a Dropbox Business team member, you may be a member of large shared folders that you don't use. If your Dropbox folder becomes too large for your hard drive to handle, you don't necessarily need to delete these folders.\nNote: Deleting files from a shared folder will delete the files for every member of that shared folder. However, if you delete the entire shared folder it will only be removed from your account.\nTo clear up your hard drive without affecting anyone else’s workflow, it is best to use selective sync. See the instructions above for using selective sync.\n:subtitle: Selective sync conflicts, and further troubleshooting\nFolders that are deselected in selective sync preferences will be removed from the Dropbox folder on your hard drive. However, if a folder is created with the same name in the same place as the unsynced folder, the new folder will appear with a gray circle and a minus sign overlay. This icon indicates the folder is not being synced to your Dropbox. If you resume syncing your old folder of the same name through selective sync preferences, the new folder and its contents will appear alongside the old folder and have \"Selective Sync Conflict\" in the folder name.\n:subtitle: Leaving shared folders\nDeselecting a shared folder from your Dropbox selective sync preferences will only prevent syncing to your computer. The shared folder will remain synced and active in the Dropbox account of other members of the shared folder. To remove yourself from a shared folder, you can either leave the shared folder from the Dropbox website or, if you're the owner of a shared folder, you can unshare the folder.\n:subtitle: Selective sync unavailable while Dropbox is paused or indexing\nIf you're running the Dropbox desktop application for the first time, you may have to wait until Dropbox has finished indexing the files in your Dropbox folder before you can access selective sync settings. If you see a message that says \"Performing initial sync with server. Please wait...,\" it means the Dropbox desktop application is in the process of indexing the files in your Dropbox folder or you have paused syncing from the Dropbox menu. You can choose to wait until indexing is complete to access your selective sync settings. Otherwise, select Cancel to dismiss the message and return to your preferences window. If you have paused syncing, you can resume syncing via the Dropbox menu.\nDropbox will continue indexing (as indicated by the icon with rotating arrows over your Dropbox icon) and you'll still be able to browse and change other preferences while Dropbox finishes.\n:subtitle: Running multiple applications\nDropbox works best when it is the only desktop application interfacing with the Dropbox folder.

By default, members of a shared folder have edit permissions—they can can add, edit, or delete files.\nSometimes you may want to let people view the files in your folder without being able to change them. Dropbox offers two ways to do this:\nYou can send a link to a file or folder, which allows recipients to view and download a copy of it. It’s a great replacement for sending email attachments.\nYou can set view-only permissions for some or all members of your shared folder. View-only permissions enables members to always see the latest versions of the files without having the ability to edit them. It’s great for keeping collaborators continuously up to date.\nOnly a shared folder owner or editor can change permissions.

If you try to do this from your computer, the application will automatically send you to the sharing options of the top-level shared folder.\nOne workaround for this is to share a link to the parent folder of the shared sub-folder. While this would give recipients of the link access to all folders in that path, any changes they make to files in that folder won't sync with your Dropbox. If you'd like to give them read-write access to the parent folder instead, you can unshare the sub-folder, share the parent folder, and then share a link to the sub-folder.\n:subtitle: What happens if two people edit a file at the same time?\nIf two people both open and edit a file in a shared folder at the same time, Dropbox will save both of their changes, but in separate files. It does not try to automatically combine or merge changes. See our article on conflicted copies to learn more about how this works.\n:subtitle: Can I reuse an invitation message after I've sent it?\nUnfortunately if an invitation to a shared folder has already been sent, there is no way to go back and copy the initial shared folder message.\n:subtitle: Is there a limit to the number of files that can be in a shared folder?\nCreating a shared folder from a folder that already contains a very large number of files will often result in an error. This error only affects the creation of a shared folder and won't affect future invitations to the folder.\nThe simple workaround is to create and share a new empty folder in your Dropbox and then move all of the files from the existing folder into the new shared folder.\nNote: Make sure you pick a good name for the shared folder as the name of a shared folder can't be changed once it is created (you can change it locally but new and existing members will see the original name).\n:subtitle: I got a message that I sent too many invitations—what should I do?\nTo prevent abuse, there is a limit on how many shared folder invitations you can send in one day. If you hit the limit, wait 24 hours before trying to send another invitation.\n:subtitle: What if my shared folder has too many files?\nSharing very large folders can cause dropbox.com to time out. If you get an error that your folder has too many files, try the following:\nOn your computer, rename the folder you're trying to share (for example, add a \"1\" or the word \"temp\" to the folder).\nCreate a new, empty folder with the name you want for your shared folder.\nShare the empty folder with the people you'd like to invite.\nOn your computer, move the files from the renamed folder (the one that was too big to share) into the new, empty shared folder.\nLet Dropbox sync this move."},{"title":"Shared links Give people viewonly access to your files   Dropbox","body":":title: Shared links: Give people view-only access to your files  – Dropbox\nView-only access lets people view, comment, and download a file.

If you make single sign-on optional, you'll need to notify them yourself. You can download an email template from the single sign-on section of the Admin Console.\n:subtitle: Accessing the website\nOnce single sign-on is turned on, users can sign in to Dropbox by entering just their email address. This will redirect them to your identity provider's sign-in page, where they can enter their work credentials.\nAs part of SSO setup, we'll provide you with a custom Dropbox URL. This URL will enable users to go directly to their Dropbox account online if they've already signed in to your identity provider.\n:subtitle: Linking computers and mobile devices\nAll computers and mobile devices that are currently linked to Dropbox accounts will continue to work as normal. However, if users need to relink a device or link a new one, they'll need the latest versions of the desktop application and mobile app in order for single sign-on to work. If they haven't signed in to your identity provider, they'll be automatically redirected to do so. They'll also be prompted to take a few other simple steps:\nWhen users link a computer, Dropbox will direct them to copy a special link code from the website and paste it into the application.\nWhen users link a mobile device, they'll be asked to approve a request to connect the app to their account.\nFor details, see our instructions for end users.\nReturn to the top of the article\n:subtitle: What identity providers do you support?\nDropbox uses the secure and widely adopted industry standard Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), which means our implementation of SSO integrates easily with any large identity provider that supports SAML. If you've built your own SAML-­based federated authentication process, we integrate with that too. We support service­-provider-initiated SAML and identity­-provider-initiated SAML.\nThe following identity providers offer preconfigured settings for Dropbox:\nAuth0\nBitium\nCA Siteminder\nCentrify\nG Suite\nMobileIron Access\nOneLogin\nOkta\nPing Identity\nSalesforce\nSymantec Identity: Access Manager\nSymplified\nReturn to the top of the article\n:subtitle: I want to set up SSO with a provider that’s not on the list. How do I configure my own identity provider solution for SSO?\nIf you’d like to configure your own solution or use a different identity provider, here are the parameters you'll need:\nDropbox uses SAML2 with the HTTP Redirect binding for SP to IdP and expects the HTTP Post binding for IdP to SP.\nThe Dropbox post-back URL (also called the Assertion Consumer Service URL) is https://www.dropbox.com/saml_login\nDropbox requires that the NameID contain the user’s email address. Technically we are looking for: Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress\"\nYour identity provider may ask if you want to sign the SAML assertion, the SAML response, or both. Dropbox requires the SAML response to be signed. You can choose signed or unsigned for the SAML assertion.\nReturn to the top of the article\n:subtitle: What's an X.509 certificate?\nAn X.509 certificate is a security certificate that's used to verify your identity. It usually comes from your identity provider. It can come in a variety of formats, but Dropbox only accepts the .pem, .cer, or .crt formats. Below is a sample of an encoded certificate:\nReturn to the top of the article\n:subtitle: What's the difference between optional mode and required mode?\nIn optional mode, all users will be able to sign in using either their Dropbox or single sign-on password. This mode is ideal if you're doing a gradual rollout of SSO and want to test it first without disrupting the activity of the team.\nIn order to sign in using single sign-on, users must leave the password field empty.

Whatever process, policies, and security features you've set up with your identity provider will apply for a user to access Dropbox. Security features that Dropbox itself provides, such as two-step verification or the ability to reset passwords, will no longer be in effect because your identity provider is now handling all aspects of authentication.

Smart Sync is also available via early access for Dropbox Business teams.\nIf you're a Dropbox Professional customer, the feature is available by default. If you're a Dropbox Business team admin, you can enable Smart Sync and get started.\nWhat does it mean for a Dropbox product to be in \"alpha\" or \"beta\"?\nSmart Sync is a Dropbox feature that helps you save space on your hard drive. Access every file and folder in your Dropbox account from your computer, using virtually no hard drive space. Smart Sync is available for Dropbox Professional customers, and members of Dropbox Business teams. With Smart Sync, you can:\nChoose if individual files or folders are available online-only or locally on your computer\nSelect a default sync setting for new files and folders that are shared with you\nWith Smart Sync, content on your computer is available as either online-only, local, or in mixed state folders.\nOnline-only content\nOnline-only content appears in the Dropbox folder on your computer, but doesn’t use the full amount of space that the file otherwise would. You can see the file, but the content isn’t fully downloaded until you need it. Only information about the file, such as the file name, location, and date the file was updated, is downloaded.\nLocal content\nLocal content is downloaded and saved on the hard drive of your computer. You can directly edit these files from applications on your computer. This content is still backed up to Dropbox as well.\nMixed state folders\nMixed state folders contain both local and online-only content.\n:subtitle: Start with Smart Sync\nWhen you start using Smart Sync:\nThere's no change to files already in the Dropbox folder on your computer\nNew content is automatically online-only unless you or your team admin chooses otherwise\nNote: To use Smart Sync, you need to install the Dropbox desktop application on your computer.\n:subtitle: Show instructions for:\n:subtitle: What are the system requirements for Smart Sync?\nSmart Sync works on Microsoft Windows Vista and above, and on Mac OSX 10.9 and above.\n:subtitle: I have folders selectively synced, how do I make my selective sync content online-only?\nFollow the steps to change the selective sync settings for your folders. Once your folders are no longer selectively synced, they automatically become online-only folders.\n:subtitle: Does changing a file to online-only delete the file from my Dropbox?\nNo, making a file online-only doesn't delete it from your Dropbox. When you make a file online-only, the file content will be deleted from your computer, but the full file will still be available in your account online and on your other devices.\n:subtitle: Do online-only files use space on my local hard drive?\nOnline-only files use a small amount of space on your hard drive to store information about the file, such as its name and size. This uses less space than the full file.\n:subtitle: Can I access online-only content when I’m not connected to the internet?\nNo, online-only content isn’t stored locally on your computer. Connect to the internet to access online-only content.\n:subtitle: Can I move online-only files within my Dropbox folder?\nYes, you can move online-only content inside the Dropbox folder on your device, and changes sync to your other devices. If you move online-only content outside of the local Dropbox folder, the content downloads to that location.\n:subtitle: What happens if I delete an online-only file or move it to my trash?\nAny actions taken on an online-only file sync to your Dropbox account and to anyone else who shares that file. Since the file isn’t stored on your computer, the file content will not be available in your trash. You can restore deleted files from your Dropbox account online.\nLearn more about restoring files.\n:subtitle: Can I use my desktop search to find online-only files or their contents?\nYou can use your desktop search to locate online-only files and folders by name. However, online-only files don't contain the full contents of your file, so your desktop search can't search file contents.\n:subtitle: Can I have different Smart Sync settings on different devices?\nYes, Smart Sync settings are unique to each device you link to your Dropbox account.\n:subtitle: Can I have local files in an online-only folder?\nYes, if a folder is online-only, you can download individual files inside the folder.\n:subtitle: Can I remove content from my device completely without removing it from my Dropbox?\nYes, if you don’t want files to appear on your device, you can use selective sync. Selective sync helps you choose which files appear in your desktop application, and which are only available online.\n:subtitle: Can I use Smart Sync on my personal account?\nSmart Sync is available for all Dropbox Professional customers. It's also available as an early access feature for Dropbox Business users. If you connected a personal account (Basic or Plus) to a Business account, Smart Sync won't be available for that personal account.\n:subtitle: Will enabling Smart Sync require a driver to be installed?\nYes, Smart Sync requires enabling a driver, known as a kernel extension on Mac, in order to integrate with your operating system’s filesystem.\nMac and Windows computers commonly use drivers to interact with peripherals such as mice and printers. Our driver allows the Dropbox client to sync files on your filesystem when you open them (for online-only content). We engineered this driver to only provide the integration necessary to power Smart Sync. It only interacts with files inside your Dropbox storage location.\nThe driver is activated when your team opts-in to enable Smart Sync.\nNote: On Windows machines, you may see a file called \"DbxSvc.exe.\" If you opt in to Smart Sync, then this file will install the driver for you.\nSmart Sync in early access is optional. If you don't opt into the early access for Smart Sync, the driver isn't installed. If one of your members wants to opt out of the early access for Smart Sync after enrolling, they can from their account settings."},{"title":"Smart Sync and system extensions  Dropbox","body":":title: Smart Sync and system extensions – Dropbox\nThe system extension for macOS is currently in closed beta for select opt-in users only. The minifilter driver for Windows will be introduced in a future version of the desktop client later this year.\nDropbox Smart Sync uses lightweight integrations with the Windows and macOS operating systems to function. These integrations are called minifilter drivers (on Windows) and system extensions (on macOS), and they allow Dropbox to automatically download your files as soon as you open them.\nThese integrations work much like the drivers you install to use a printer, copier, or external mouse. In this case, these integrations allow the Dropbox Smart Sync feature to work. You won’t see either the system extension or driver unless you use Dropbox Smart Sync.\n:subtitle: Why do I see a System Extension Blocked message when I install Dropbox?\nOn macOS 10.13 (High Sierra), you may see a System Extension Blocked prompt when trying to run the Dropbox desktop application for the first time. If you don’t allow access for the system extension, you won’t be able to use Smart Sync.\nTo enable the Dropbox system extension, simply follow the steps that appear on your computer as you’re setting up Dropbox:\nIn the Enable Smart Sync box, click Continue.\nIn the System Extension Blocked box, click OK.\nIn the Allow Dropbox in Preferences box, click Open Preferences.\nUnder the General settings in Security & Privacy, click Allow.\nNote: You may first need to click the lock icon and sign in to your computer\nImportant notes\nIf you don’t have admin privileges on your computer, you may need to contact IT or another admin to change this setting\nDropbox will still work even if you don’t enable the system extension, but you won’t be able to use the Smart Sync feature\nSmart Sync is only available for certain Dropbox plans\n:subtitle: What happens if I don't allow access?\nIf you don’t allow access for the system extension or driver, you won't be able to use Dropbox Smart Sync. However, the main Dropbox desktop application will still work like normal.\n:subtitle: What if I unintentionally denied the system extension? Can I change this later?\nIf you unintentionally exited out of this process, you can easily allow Dropbox access:\nClick the dropbox icon in the system tray or menu bar.\nClick the gear icon.\nClick Preferences.\nClick Enable Smart Sync.\nIf needed, click the lock icon and sign in to your computer.\nClick Privacy.\nUnder Allow the apps below to control your computer, check the box beside the Dropbox icon.\n:subtitle: How do the system extension and driver work?\nUse of a system extension or driver is common among many popular systems:\nHardware—like your computer’s hard drive, printers, and copiers\nFilesystems—like those exposed through Server Message Block (SMB)\nSoftware—like antivirus or virtualization programs\n:subtitle: Permissions\nDropbox used publicly-available APIs from Apple and Microsoft to write the system extension and driver. No additional admin permissions are required (beyond what Dropbox has always needed to function).\n:subtitle: What does the Dropbox system extension actually do?\nSystem extensions enable \"callbacks.\" Callbacks are real-time calls that confirm you have permission to do things like move, delete, or change ownership of files in shared spaces (like a folder). If you don’t have these file access permissions, system extensions allow Dropbox to send warnings when you may be taking an action that could unshare folders or delete shared content.\n:subtitle: Security and usage\nSystem extensions and drivers can give applications additional access to your computer’s operating system. Dropbox is cautious in only using these extensions to improve your experience with our app.\nSome notes on what we don’t do:\nWe don’t use system extensions to interact with any files other than those stored in your Dropbox\nWe don’t use system extensions to make network requests\nWe don’t use system extensions to parse any data in the filesystem\nWe don’t use system extensions to read or write files\n:subtitle: Security and stability\nDropbox takes great measures to protect your data and privacy, and we designed the system extension and driver with security and stability as top priorities. In fact, many of the engineers who wrote this extension previously worked on filesystem technologies at various OS vendors.\nThese components have gone through extensive security reviews with internal security teams, as well as audits done by external penetration testers. We’ve run these components both internally at Dropbox and in cooperation with enterprise-scale beta customers. In both cases these components ran successfully.\n:subtitle: Alternatives\nThese integrations are core to current and future Dropbox client services. There is no way to disable or opt-out of using the system extension or minifilter driver on the Dropbox desktop client. Doing so would also disable important alerts that prevent users from accidentally deleting shared data, or taking unintended file actions.\nIf you don’t want to install the Dropbox desktop application, you can view, share, and download your files without the desktop integration by using only the Dropbox website at dropbox.com.\n:subtitle: Can I choose to not install this extension?\nPlease note that your privacy and security are of the utmost importance to us. Smart Sync and this component have been subjected to rigorous testing and inspection to ensure stability and security.\nRead more about Dropbox trust and security.\nRead our detailed technical blog about Smart Sync and the driver.\nSmart Sync is an opt-in feature so you can choose to opt-out if you wish to do so. However, you cannot use Smart Sync without enabling the system extension or driver.\n:subtitle: I'm a Professional customer. Can I opt out of the system extension?\nYes. If you use Dropbox Professional, you can opt out of the system extension at any time. However, please note that opting out of the system extension will disable Smart Sync. You must have the system extension enabled to use Smart Sync.\nTo disable the system extension:\nSign in to dropbox.com.\nClick your avatar at the top of any page.\nClick Settings.\nScroll to Dropbox system extension.\nToggle this setting to off.\nNote: This opt-out experience is only available for Dropbox Professional customers."},{"title":"Smart Sync for team admins  Dropbox","body":":title: Smart Sync for team admins – Dropbox\nThis article discusses a feature that's available to all Dropbox Professional customers, and via early access for Dropbox Business teams.

Try viewing the file in a third-party application to find out if there's an issue with the actual file:\nOpen the Dropbox app and navigate to the file.\nTap on the arrow to the right of the file.\nScroll up and select Export.\nChoose an approriate app to open your file in (for example, if you're exporting a photo file, choose a photo viewing app).\nIf you cannot view the file in another app, your file may be corrupted. If this is the case, you will not be able to view the file in the Dropbox app.\n:subtitle: What if I can't open, preview, upload, or download a file on the Dropbox Android app?\nThe Dropbox Android app requires an internet connection to open, preview, and upload or download files. If you can't complete one of these actions, verify that you have a strong WiFi or data connection and try reloading your file.\nIf you are connected to internet and still having issues, try signing out and signing back in:\nTap the menu button on the top-left of the screen.\nTap the gear icon (or Settings in older versions of the app).\nTap Sign out from Dropbox.\n:subtitle: Is my download or upload failing due to file size?\nYou may encounter issues downloading large files from the Dropbox app on your mobile device. Unfortunately our mobile clients do not have a \"resume download\" feature, so large files (usually those larger than 100MB) may not download properly.

Why is this happening? – Dropbox\nThere are a couple of common reasons why photos you don't recognize can appear in your Dropbox. To determine if one of them is occuring, refer to the following steps.\n:subtitle: Find the location and origin of the photos\nAccess your photos at photos.dropbox.com.\nRight-click any unfamiliar photo and select Show in Folder. This opens a new browser window, and shows you where the file is located in your Dropbox account.\nRight-click the photo again and select Previous versions. You'll see which user and device added this file to your account.\nNow that you have these pieces of information, check to see if one of the two scenarios below apply to you:\n:subtitle: Are the photos in a folder called Camera Uploads?\nWhen enabled, the Camera Upload feature will automatically upload photos and videos from a camera, phone, tablet, SD card, or other media device connected to a computer running the Dropbox desktop app. Before uploading from one of these devices, a pop-up window will ask the user if he or she wants to use Camera Upload for that device. If the user confirms the use of Camera Upload, photos and videos will be imported from that device to the Dropbox account associated with it. The user may only see this pop-up message the first time a device is connected. Once a device has been approved for Camera Upload, the photos and videos from that device will be automatically uploaded to Dropbox every time that device is connected to the computer.\nIf the photos were uploaded to the Camera Uploads folder from a computer, it may mean that someone connected a device to your computer. For example, someone may have used your computer to charge their phone or connected a USB memory stick to transfer a file even without you being aware and clicked \"OK\" on the Camera Upload message without realizing. If they did this, their photos and videos would be uploaded to your account. You can fix this by deleting the photos and videos from your Dropbox account. This will not delete files from the device that uploaded the photos and videos or from any other Dropbox account.\nIf the files were uploaded to the Camera Uploads folder from a mobile device, it means that your Dropbox account is signed in to a mobile device with Camera Upload enabled. This could have happened if you forgot to sign out from a mobile device that did not belong to you. It is also possible that someone has access to your password and signed in to your account from a mobile device. You should make sure that your email account is secure and that your Dropbox account has a strong, unique password. Additionally, you should also review the devices linked to your account on your security page and unlink any that are unfamiliar to you.\n:subtitle: Are the photos in a shared folder?\nShared folders are an easy way to share content with others. Anything that is placed in a shared folder is available to all of the members of that shared folder.\nIf the photos are in a shared folder you belong to, it means that one of the members of the shared folder added the photos to that folder, either intentionally or by mistake. If you don't think that these files should be in that shared folder, please reach out to the person who added them to suggest another location.\nIf neither scenario above explains how the photos appeared in your Dropbox, contact Dropbox Support and send us the names of a few photos that aren't yours but are in your account.

The AD Connector doesn't update unmanaged users.

However, the file is not yet permanently deleted. Rather, it's moved into a queue for permanent deletion. This queuing enables features like file recovery and version history. Depending on what type of Dropbox account you have, file recovery and version history differs:\nFor most Basic and Plus users, files are recoverable for 30 days\nFor Plus subscribers with extended version history, files are recoverable for 1 year\nFor most Professional and Dropbox Business customers, files are available for 120 days\n:subtitle: Permanent deletions\nYou can permanently delete a file yourself to skip the above queuing process. Permanent deletion of a file will not allow you or Dropbox to restore these files at a later date. This applies to manually permanently deleting a file, as well as a file exceeding the recovery period specific to your account type. Here's what you should know about permanent deletions:\nThis action will begin a permanent deletion process that can take up to 60 days in the normal course of operations.\nPermanently deleting a file means that you will not be able to recover it.\n:subtitle: What happens when I delete files from a shared folder?\nIf you delete a file from a shared folder (whether you created the shared folder or joined someone else's), any member of the folder may be able to restore the file.\nIf you delete a shared folder from your Dropbox account, you're leaving the folder, not deleting it for everyone else. This means that the shared folder and the files in it will remain available to the other members it was shared with. You also have the ability to add the folder back to your Dropbox account.\nTo completely delete a shared folder and its files from all members of the shared folder, you will first need to unshare the shared folder.\nData destruction mechanisms\nDropbox uses a secure deletion process to delete data from our servers. Additionally, when a Dropbox storage disk has reached the end of its useful life or is damaged, we follow a decommissioning process that is designed to physically destroy the disk to the point data cannot be recovered. Our third-party service providers also follow secure destruction processes for media they control.\n:subtitle: Dropbox Business Administrators\nWhen you remove a team member using the delete user function, the non-shared files are still associated with the disabled account.

Your Plus subscription will now be associated with email address B and your Basic account will be associated with email address A.\n:subtitle: Merge files by unlinking and relinking your Dropbox accounts\nThe merge option is useful for transfering all of your files to a new Dropbox, or combining two Dropbox accounts that have completely different contents. However, if the two Dropbox accounts have similar—but not identical—content, merging could cause problems.\nFor example, if you have a folder in both Dropbox accounts, but the files in each version differ even slightly, the entire folder will be duplicated. In this situation you should probably choose not to merge. You can also avoid the choice altogether by deleting, renaming, or moving the old Dropbox folder before you relink your computer.\nTo merge accounts you will need two email addresses: one that is currently linked with your computer (A), and one that is linked to a second account where you'd like to merge all of your files (B).\nIf you have not yet done so, install the Dropbox desktop client. Next, sign in to your free Dropbox account. Dropbox will begin syncing the files associated with this account to your computer.\nOn your desktop, click the Dropbox icon on the systems tray or menu bar.\nClick the gear icon, select Preferences…, and then open the Account tab.\nClick Unlink This Dropbox... and confirm your choice.\nDropbox will prompt you to sign in again. Enter the email address and password for Account B.\nThe application will detect that another Dropbox folder already exists on the computer and will give you two options: Choose Another Location or Install.\nChoose the Install option so that your two Dropbox folders (one will be named \"Dropbox (old)\" and the other simply \"Dropbox\") will be in the same location on your computer.\nDrag the \"Dropbox (old)\" folder into the \"Dropbox\" folder and wait for all of the files to sync.\nYou will see a green checkmark when all of your files are successfully merged and synced into Account B.\nNote: If the account that is currently linked to your computer is not the account that you wish to use on this device, feel free to repeat steps 1 to 3 and sign in with your other account."},{"title":"What if dropboxcom fails to load or loads incorrectly  Dropbox","body":":title: What if dropbox.com fails to load, or loads incorrectly? – Dropbox\nIf dropbox.com fails to load in your web browser, or if it partially loads or shows other errors, you're likely encountering a browser issue.\n:subtitle: How do I know if the problem I'm having is due to browser issues?\nBelow is a list of some of the ways that browser issues can affect your usage of dropbox.com:\nWeb features\nYou're not able to print a receipt\nYour files or folders aren't appearing in the correct locations\nThe search bar isn't working\nError messages\nYou're seeing an Error 404 message\nYou're seeing a message that says There was a problem completing this request\nLoading issues\nThe browser window-loading wheel won't stop spinning\n:subtitle: What can I do to resolve browser issues?\nIf you're encountering any of the above issues, or something else you suspect is related to your web browser, it's important to know that these are not issues with dropbox.com.

Can I select which files to sync? – Dropbox\nDropbox will sync files to your computer in order of size. Dropbox starts syncing the smallest files in your Dropbox folder first and continues until there are no more files to sync or it runs out of hard drive space.\nIf you have more stuff in your Dropbox than you have space available on your hard drive, you might want to exclude some of the folders in your Dropbox folder from syncing to your computer. To do this, you'll want to specify the folders using selective sync.\nSelective sync allows you to exclude folders you don't want to sync on a per-computer basis. For example, you can exclude your home videos from the Dropbox folder on your work computer, or prevent any large files from syncing to your laptop. To specify your selective sync settings, choose which folders to exclude from your Dropbox application preferences.\nNote: Wait until the folder has uploaded completely (it displays the green checkmark) before unselecting it in your selective sync settings."},{"title":"What if theres an error creating the Dropbox folder in a new location  Dropbox","body":":title: What if there's an error creating the Dropbox folder in a new location? – Dropbox\nIf you're moving your Dropbox folder, Dropbox may not be able to create it in a new location if any of the following are true:\n:subtitle: Your hard drive, or the destination for the Dropbox folder, is low on space\n:subtitle: Files or folders are in use\n:subtitle: Incorrect folder permissions\n:subtitle: You're using symlinks or referenced files\nYour hard drive, or the destination for the Dropbox folder, is low on space\nIt's possible that there's not enough room to move or save the entirety of the data stored in your Dropbox folder.\nTo check whether this is true for you, view your available hard drive space.

Participants can earn up to 25 GB per person for two years by rallying others at their school to join in. The more your school participates, the more space everyone earns.\n:subtitle: Dropbox Campus Cup—frequently asked questions\n:subtitle: How do I sign up for Campus Cup?\nVisit the Campus Cup homepage\nSign in to your Dropbox Basic or Pro account (if you’re not signed in already)\nOr create an account, if you don’t yet have one\nVerify an email address from a college, university, or higher education institution (for example, one with an \".ac\" or \".edu\" domain)\nCheck your email to verify and complete signup\nNote: If the Campus Cup signup page fails to load, appears blank, or loads only a solid color, you may be encountering an issue with AdBlock. If this is happening for you, try disabling any AdBlock software or plugins on your web browser, and then reloading the Campus Cup page.\n:subtitle: When does Campus Cup start and end?\nThe official Campus Cup challenge begins on September 17, 2015 and ends on December 14, 2015. During this time you can earn Dropbox space for yourself and others at your school. You won’t be able to earn additional space after December 14, 2015. However, the space you earn through Campus Cup will be available on the Dropbox account you signed in with for two years (through January 16, 2018).\n:subtitle: Am I eligible for Campus Cup?\nTo participate, you must:\nHave a Dropbox Basic or Pro account, or create one for Campus Cup\nHave a valid email address from a college, university, or higher education institution (for example, one with an \".ac\" or \".edu\" domain)\nExceptions:\nDropbox Business accounts are ineligible for Campus Cup, however you can create a new Dropbox Basic or Pro account, and use this personal account to participate\nAlumni emails may be ineligible\nThe following email domains—and associated sub-domains—are not eligible to participate in Campus Cup, and they cannot be used to verify eligibility for Campus Cup:\nmit.edu\nsi.edu\nfullerton.edu (example sub-domain: csu.fullerton.edu)\nNote: students and faculty at these universities can join their school's Dropbox Business team to get 25 GB (students) or more space (faculty).\nLearn how you can join a Dropbox Business team.\n:subtitle: What if my school doesn't provide me with an email address?\nIn order to verify eligibility for Campus Cup, you must have a valid university email address (for example, one with an \".ac\" or \".edu\" domain). If your school does not provide an email address for you, then you will not be able to participate in Campus Cup. However, you can still earn additional Dropbox space (up to 16GB for a basic account) by referring friends and family to Dropbox.\n:subtitle: How do I earn extra space?\nSpace is earned through completing the following actions, which help you earn points toward your school’s overall ranking:\n:subtitle: Action\n:subtitle: Points\nInstall Dropbox on your computer and sign in\nInstall the Dropbox mobile app and sign in\nCreate a new shared folder\nCreate a new shared link\nCreate a new file request\nInvite a friend—and have that friend join—during your first week participating in Campus Cup\n3 (per referral)\nInvite a friend—and have that friend join—after your first week participating in Campus Cup\n1 (per referral)\nNote: The people you invite during your first week participating in Campus Cup must also accept that invite within your first week in order to earn the three points for your school.\n:subtitle: How much space can I earn, and when will space be granted?\nParticipants in Campus Cup can earn 3, 8, 15, or 25 GB of extra space, which will be available for two years. New space will be granted within 1 hour of your school crossing each point threshold.\n:subtitle: How many points does it take to reach each space threshold?\nThe number of points needed to reach each space threshold differs by school, and depends on factors like school size. You can find your school’s threshold by hovering over the blue icons in the rainbow graphic on the participant page.\n:subtitle: I completed a certain action before I signed up for Campus Cup. Do I get the points automatically?\nIf you already have Dropbox installed on your computer or mobile device, you will automatically earn Campus Cup points for this action. However, other point-earning actions must be completed after you’ve verified your email address and successfully joined Campus Cup.\n:subtitle: Do I earn a regular referral bonus for inviting people to Campus Cup?\nYes. If you successfully invite people to participate in Campus Cup, and they are also new to Dropbox, you earn referral bonus space.\nIf you've reached the maximum referral bonus space (16 GB for free accounts, 32 GB for Pro accounts), you cannot earn a referral bonus. However, you still qualify for any extra space earned from Campus Cup.\n:subtitle: I meet the requirements—why can’t I sign up for Campus Cup?\nAre you using a valid school email address to sign up?\nIn order to verify eligibility for Campus Cup, you must have a valid university email address (for example, one with an \".ac\" or \".edu\" domain). If your school does not provide an email address for you, then you will not be able to participate in Campus Cup. However, you can still earn additional Dropbox space (up to 16GB for a basic account) by referring friends and family to Dropbox.\nAre you trying to verify the same school email address more than once?\nYou can only verify a school email address once. If you already verified this email address for Campus Cup, you cannot verify your email address again.\nAre you trying to use multiple school email addresses with the same Dropbox account?\nYou can only use one email address per Dropbox account for Campus Cup.\nAre you using the same email address that you verified with Campus Cup?\nYou must opt in to Campus Cup using the same Dropbox account used to request the verification email. Be sure that you’re not logged in to a different Dropbox account when you click the email verification link.\nIs your school eligible?\nOnly students, faculty, or staff of eligible higher education institutions can participate. If you’re receiving an error when you attempt to sign up with an email address from your educational institution, it may be that we haven’t yet verified your school’s eligibility. We review errors, and if we discover that you are using a valid email address from an eligible school, we’ll contact you once we’ve resolved the error.\nThe following email domains—and associated sub-domains—are not eligible to participate in Campus Cup, and they cannot be used to verify eligibility for Campus Cup:\nmit.edu\nsi.edu\nfullerton.edu (example sub-domain: csu.fullerton.edu)\nHowever, students and faculty at these institutions can join their school's Dropbox Business team to get 25GB (students) or more space (faculty).\nLearn how you can join a Dropbox Business account.\n:subtitle: My school uses multiple email domains—do they count as the same school?\nIn most cases, yes: If your school uses multiple domains (for example \"math.yourschool.edu\" and \"cs.yourschool.edu\") in email addresses, all count as part of the same school.\nHowever, in a few cases where a school has multiple email domains, our system did not recognize that these belonged to the same institution. In these cases, the domains were treated as separate schools in Campus Cup.\nPlease note that this should not significantly impact a participant's ability to earn space. The number of points required to reach a threshold has been statistically normalized between universities. This accounts for the fact that schools with larger enrollments are able to earn points faster than schools with smaller enrollments, but will also help in cases where multiple domains are treated as separate schools.\n:subtitle: Can I change the Dropbox account I'm using for Campus Cup?\nNo, but you can change the primary email of your Dropbox account.\n:subtitle: What if I linked my school address to someone else’s Dropbox account, or to an account I can no longer access?\nIf you're having trouble participating in Campus Cup because you accidentally linked your school address to someone else's account, or to an account you can no longer access, you can link your school email address to a different Dropbox account.\n:subtitle: Can more than one person receive points for a Campus Cup referral?\nNo. Only the sender of a referral link can earn referral points (provided the recipient uses the link to sign up). However, students, faculty, and staff of schools are working together in Campus Cup. Any person from your school who signs up will help you and your school get closer to earning extra space.\n:subtitle: Who can see my email information?\nBy participating in Campus Cup, you make your school email address viewable to all other participants at your school.\n:subtitle: When does Campus Cup space expire, and what happens then?\nCampus Cup space expires on January 16, 2018, or if you upgrade to a Dropbox Business account (whichever comes earlier). At this point, the space earned through Campus Cup will be removed from each participating Dropbox account. Your Dropbox quota will be decreased, reflecting this change.\nAll files in your Dropbox will still be available, even if the loss of the promotional space puts you over quota. However, Dropbox will stop syncing, meaning that new files added to your Dropbox won't sync to your devices or the Dropbox website. Syncing will resume when your Dropbox is again below quota.\nAlternatively, you can upgrade your account.\n:subtitle: If my school email address expires, what happens to my Dropbox space?\nIf your school email address expires (because you’ve graduated, for example), you retain access to the stuff in your Dropbox. However, you will no longer receive sharing notifications, password resets, or any other critical communications from Dropbox.\nNote: We recommend that you change the primary email address on your Dropbox account if you anticipate that that email address will expire.\n:subtitle: I’m a Dropbox Business user—can I still participate in Campus Cup?\nYes. Simply visit the Campus Cup homepage and create a new Dropbox Basic or Pro account. You can then use this account to participate in Campus Cup.\nIf your school email address is associated with a Dropbox Business account, you can still use that address to verify eligibility in Campus Cup.\nNote: The following email domains, and associated sub-domains, are not eligible to participate in Campus Cup, and they cannot be used to verify eligibility for Campus Cup:\nmit.edu\nsi.edu\nfullerton.edu (Example of sub-domain: csu.fullerton.edu)\nHowever, students and faculty at these institutions can join their school's Dropbox Business team to get 25GB (students) or more space (faculty).\n:subtitle: What happens if I sign up for Campus Cup with a Dropbox Basic or Pro account, but then join a Dropbox Business team?\nIf you join a Dropbox Business team using the same Dropbox account used to participate in Campus Cup, the points you contributed to your school will still count. But you will no longer be able to participate in Campus Cup using that account.\nHowever, in the process of joining the Dropbox Business team you will be presented with the option to create and pair a personal account. This option will appear as Move my files to a new personal Dropbox. If you select this option, the space you earned in Campus Cup will be added to this new personal account.\nIf you do not select this option, the space you earned in Campus Cup will not be transferable to any future personal Dropbox account.\nIf you join a Dropbox Business team using a different Dropbox account, then none of the above applies to you.\nTo clarify, here are the scenarios in which migration does and does not apply:\nThe migration scenario applies in two cases:\nYou participate in Campus Cup with a Dropbox account that’s been created using a non-school email address, and use this same address to join a Dropbox Business team\nYou participate in Campus Cup with a Dropbox account that’s been created using your school’s email address, and then migrate to Dropbox Business using that same email address\nThis migration scenario does not apply in the following two cases:\nYou participate in Campus Cup using a Dropbox account created with a non-school email address, and then use your school’s email address to join a Dropbox Business team\nYou participate in Campus Cup using a Dropbox account created with a school email address, and then use your non-school email address to join a Dropbox Business team\nLearn how to pair a personal and Business account, and move files between the two.\nNote: This rule applies until the day that Campus Cup space expires: January 16, 2018.\nNote: If you join a Dropbox Business team using the same Dropbox account used to participate in Campus Cup, you will no longer be able to use that email to re-verify eligibility for Campus Cup.\n:subtitle: Where can I read the full Campus Cup terms of participation and eligibility?\nRead the full Campus Cup terms.\n:subtitle: Campus Cup frequently asked questions:\nHow do I sign up for Campus Cup?\nWhen does Campus Cup start and end?\nAm I eligible for Campus Cup?\nWhat if my school doesn't provide me with an email address?\nHow do I earn extra space?\nHow much space can I earn, and when will space be granted?\nHow many points does it take to reach each space threshold?\nI completed a certain action before I signed up for Campus Cup.

Well, when you add a file to your computer's Dropbox, the file is then synced with Dropbox servers. Dropbox will then initiate the syncing process as soon as it determines a change has been made to the file. All linked computers and shared folders will then download any new version of the file. With LAN syncing, Dropbox will look for the new file on your Local Area Network first, bypassing the need to download the file from Dropbox servers, thus speeding up the syncing process considerably.\nLAN sync is an extra advantage for use in locations where computers are networked together over the same router or other local area network.\nNote: Bandwidth settings don't apply to LAN sync.\nDropbox needs to maintain a connection to the Internet in order to determine when to sync. To take advantage of LAN sync, all computers need to be connected to a LAN and the Internet at the same time.\nIf you are installing the Dropbox desktop application for the first time, Windows firewall might ask you for permission to allow Dropbox access to the internet and/or your LAN. Press Access to allow Dropbox to sync properly.\nIf Dropbox detects a firewall preventing access to your LAN, it will turn off LAN sync in your Dropbox preferences automatically. To turn it back on, change your Firewall settings to allow Dropbox access to the Internet and your LAN, then manually turn on LAN sync in your Dropbox preferences.\nLAN sync only works with computers that are on the same subnet, or broadcast address. For example, usually all computers connected to a single router are on the same network (same subnet). If your LAN uses multiple network devices, such as routers, to extend its network, you will want to be on the same subnet as the other LAN sync-enabled computers. If this sounds foreign to you, you may want to consult your network device's documentation or a network administrator for help.\nLAN Sync requires access to TCP port 17500."},{"title":"What is a pending or invalid invite  Dropbox","body":":title: What is a pending or invalid invite? – Dropbox\n:subtitle: Pending invite\nUnaccepted invites to join your Dropbox Business team are called \"pending invites\".\n:subtitle: Send reminders for all pending invites\nSign in to your admin account at dropbox.com.\nIn the left sidebar, click Admin Console.\nClick Dashboard in the sidebar.\nUnder Pending invites, click Send reminders.\nIn the pop-up window, enter a message, and click Send message.\nEveryone with a pending invite will receive an email with your message and a link to join the team.\n:subtitle: Resend an invite to an individual\nIf you want to send an individual reminder or resend an invite to just one person at a time, you can do that from the Members page.\nSign in to your admin account at dropbox.com.\nIn the left sidebar, click Admin Console.\nOn the Members tab, click the gear icon for a person who appears in gray and has Invited status.\nSelect Resend invite from the menu.\nIn the pop-up window, click Resend invite.\nThe invite will be sent to that person's email address again.\n:subtitle: Invalid invite\nInvites with the phrase \"invalid\" next to it mean that the team member's email address may have changed since you sent the invitation."},{"title":"What is a system tray or menu bar  Dropbox","body":":title: What is a system tray or menu bar? – Dropbox\nIn our help center, we refer to the the bars along the top or bottom of your computer screen as the system tray (Windows/Linux) or menu bar (Mac).

Enabling two-step verification means that Dropbox will require a six-digit security code—in addition to a password—when you sign in to your account, or when you link a new computer, phone, or tablet.

Merging teams will simplify ownership, billing, policy enforcement, and even make it easier for your teams to collaborate.\nIf you'd like to merge separate Dropbox Business teams into a single team, simply contact Dropbox support (contact info is located under the Help tab in the Admin Console). But first, read below for answers to some frequently asked questions about merging Dropbox Business teams.\n:subtitle: What will change if I merge my team into a new, primary team?\nWhen merging teams, you'll need to decide whether your team will become the primary team (the one that's joined by others), or a secondary team (one that joins a primary team). If your team is merging as a secondary team:\nThe following items will not be transferred to the new team (meaning you'll want to save them before merging):\nDeleted team member accounts\nActivity logs\nAdmin permissions\nTeam API apps\nInvoices and receipts\nThe following items will be different once you join the new team:\nIf the secondary and primary teams have team folders with the same name, the secondary team's folder will be renamed\nFor example, a team folder called \"Marketing\" would become \"Marketing (1)\"\nGroups will be renamed to include your team name\nFor example, a group called \"Marketing\" will be renamed\"[secondary team name] - Marketing\"\nThe following items may be different, depending on the settings of the primary team:\nSharing permissions may change\nSSO may be required\nTeam folders may be added to the accounts of members of the secondary team\nIf you're a Dropbox Business team member and you need help or have questions about these changes, please contact your new admin (the admin of the primary team).\n:subtitle: What will change if a secondary team merges into my primary team?\nGroups will be transferred from the secondary team, and will include the secondary team's name\nFor example, a group called \"Marketing\" will be renamed\"[secondary team name] - Marketing\"\nYour allotted licenses will be used for both secondary team members and newly invited members\nYou will need to be sure you have enough licenses available for each new member to join\nTeam admins will receive an email stating that the teams have been merged\nTeam members on the secondary team will also receive an email to let them know they are on a new team\nPlease note that if you require SSO, you'll need to ensure that each new member from the secondary team is added through your SSO provider."},{"title":"Whats a conflicted copy  Dropbox","body":":title: What's a conflicted copy? – Dropbox\nIf two people change the same file at the same time, Dropbox won't try to merge the changes. Instead, it will save the original file as well as a second version which has the same name but is appended with \"conflicted copy,\" the name of the person or computer responsible, and the date the conflict occurred. By creating a conflicted file, Dropbox ensures that all changes are preserved and nobody will overwrite another person's hard work.\nConflicting changes are saved separately\nConflicted copies can also occur when a file is left open on another computer, especially when using applications with an auto-save feature. Closing the file from within the application on either computer should prevent further conflicts.\nOne workaround that can be used to prevent conflicted copies is to move the file out of the Dropbox folder while editing it. Doing this causes the file to appear as deleted and doesn't allow other users to edit the file. Once you're done editing, you can move the file back into its original location in the Dropbox folder. It will reappear with your edits for all users who have access to that file.\nAnother option is to move the file into a second folder designated for \"In Use\" files. Other members of the shared folder can still access it if they need to, but will know not to make changes."},{"title":"Whats a file request and how do I create one  Dropbox","body":":title: What's a file request and how do I create one? – Dropbox\nFile requests allows you to collect and receive files—big or small — from anyone, right into your Dropbox.

If you verified that your computers are online and in sync, but a file still isn't appearing where expected, then there may be an issue with the file itself.\nOperating systems don't always play nicely with one another. The Dropbox desktop app tracks these inconsistencies and will try its best to resolve the problem gracefully. When it can't, the file will still sync to dropbox.com, but it may not appear or work properly on incompatible operating systems.\nTo see which of your files may cause syncing problems, sign in to dropbox.com and use the Dropbox bad files check tool.\n:subtitle: Learn more\nTo ensure your files and folders sync correctly on other operating systems, try to follow these guidelines:\n:subtitle: Incompatible characters for all operating systems\nDon't name your files with the following characters, as Dropbox will not sync them on any platform:\n/ (forward slash)\n\\ (backslash)\nNote: Dropbox will sync files that include a forward slash in the file name to dropbox.com on Mac computers only. However, these files will sync to dropbox.com with a : (colon) in place of the / (forward slash). Files with forward slashes sync to other Mac computers, but they can't be synced to Windows computers.\n:subtitle: Incompatible characters with Windows\nWhen naming your files, avoid characters incompatible with the Windows file system:\n< (less than)\n> (greater than)\n: (colon)\n\" (double quote)\n| (vertical bar or pipe)\n? (question mark)\n* (asterisk)\n. (period) or a space at the end of a file or folder name\n:subtitle: Reserved filenames in Windows\nWindows has a set of reserved words that can’t be used as valid filenames. If you create and name a file or folder from dropbox.com or a non-Windows device that includes a reserved word, then the file will not sync to your Dropbox on Windows computers. For a complete list of reserved file names, please see the Naming Conventions section of Windows Developer Network.\n:subtitle: Ignored files\nSome small system files aren't synced over Dropbox. These include:\ndesktop.ini\nthumbs.db\n.ds_store\nicon\\r\n.dropbox\n.dropbox.attr\n:subtitle: Max character length\nWindows only allows file and folder names of 260 characters or less; however, current versions of the Dropbox desktop app are able to read and write to locations that are longer than 260 characters long without problems.\nSome applications might still be subject to the operating system limits and may have problems accessing files that are in long paths. Additionally, some applications—such as Microsoft Excel—have shorter limits (218 characters).\nFor example, if you have an Excel 2010 file in a path that is 261 characters long, Dropbox will sync it to your computer. However, when you try to open it Excel, Dropbox will show an error message like File Cannot be accessed. To fix this problem, shorten the name or move the file or folder to a higher-level folder.\nNote: Windows counts the file path as part of the name. This sample file path is 142 characters, not the 16 characters of the file name:\nC:\\Users\\Panda\\My Documents\\Dropbox\\Creative Nonfiction\\My Autobiography\\Favorite Things\\Favorite Foods\\Bamboo\\Family Recipes\\Fresh Leaves.doc\n:subtitle: Case conflicts\nMost Linux installations allow you to have two files or folders with the same name but different capitalization. However, by default, Mac and Windows won't differentiate file or folder names by case. Therefore, if Dropbox comes across Linux directories named \"Sample folder\" and \"sample folder\" (lowercase \"s\"), it will still sync both folders to Mac and Windows computers. But one folder will appear as a copy of the original folder and will be appended with case conflict.\n:subtitle: Beginning characters on Mac and Linux\nFiles or folders that begin with a period (e.g. .myfile.doc) will sync properly to the Dropbox folder on your computer. However, Mac and Linux operating systems will regard filenames that begin with a period as system files and hide the files automatically. You won’t be able to see the files without modifying advanced settings on your computer. Instead, you can sign in to dropbox.com and rename the files or folders (e.g. _myfolder).\n:subtitle: Trailing characters\nFiles and folders that end with periods (.) won't sync properly between operating systems. If a file ends in a period, like file.txt., the file won't sync and it will appear in bad files check.\nTrailing spaces in file and folder names are stripped in order to sync properly with other operating systems. If Dropbox finds a file in your Dropbox folder with the same name but different only in white space (or the character created by pressing the space bar), it will add the file to your Dropbox folder and append the file name with white space conflict.\n:subtitle: Temporary files\nWhen some applications (such as Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint) open a file, they will often save a temporary file in the same directory and name it in one of the following ways:\nName begins with ~$ (a tilde and dollar sign) or .~ (a period and tilde)\nName begins with a tilde and ends in .tmp, such as ~myfile.tmp\nDropbox does not sync these temporary files on any operating system.\n:subtitle: Unicode encoding conflicts\nIn some instances, there are several ways to create the same character on your keyboard. Although the characters may look the same, they are not the same to operating systems and Dropbox. When Dropbox notices these encoding conflicts, it will create a conflicted copy of the file and save it in the same folder appended with Unicode Encoding Conflict.\n:subtitle: Metadata and resource forks\nAvoid syncing files that use metadata (or resource forks), including Mac aliases or Windows shortcuts. These types of files typically only work on the operating systems they were created on.\n:subtitle: Junction points and aliases\nDropbox will follow Windows junction points (Windows Vista or later) and sync the files or folders they link to. However, any changes to those files or folders made from the Windows operating system will not sync again until the Dropbox desktop app is restarted. To get around this, move the original folder to your Dropbox and add a junction point from its previous location to link to its new location in the Dropbox folder.\n:subtitle: A warning regarding metadata and FAT32 drives\nSome documents have file attributes, or xattrs, in data attached to the file. We call this data metadata. Operating systems use metadata in many different ways: storing the icon, labeling your documents, attaching information to the file, permissions, and so on. Dropbox supports xattrs on all platforms. However, thumb drives and portable drives that use the FAT32 file system do not support metadata. If your Dropbox folder is on a FAT32 drive, unfortunately it is impossible to retain metadata when the file is moved or renamed.\n:subtitle: Monitoring more than 10,000 folders on Linux\nThe Linux version of the Dropbox desktop app is limited from monitoring more than 10000 folders by default. Anything more than that is not watched and, therefore, ignored when syncing. There's an easy fix for this. Open a terminal and enter the following:\necho fs.inotify.max_user_watches=100000 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf; sudo sysctl -p\nThis command will tell your system to watch up to 100,000 folders. Once the command is entered and you enter your password, Dropbox will immediately resume syncing.\n:subtitle: Turning on extended attribute (xattr) support in Linux\nSome Linux distributions have extended attributes (xattrs) turned off by default. If you're running a Linux distribution with an ext3 or ext4 file system, it's possible to turn on xattr support, typically through your /etc/fstab settings file. Please refer to your Linux distribution's documentation for instructions.\n:subtitle: Using referenced files in Dropbox\nWe strongly recommend against methods that add referenced files (symlinks, junction points, or networked folders) to the Dropbox folder. Using reference files can cause high CPU usage, poor syncing performance, permissions issues, and quota usage disparities."},{"title":"Why arent my photos appearing in the mobile app  Dropbox","body":":title: Why aren't my photos appearing in the mobile app? – Dropbox\nIf you don't see some of your photos on the Photos tab, they might be missing information about when they were taken.\nA digital photo usually has various pieces of information embedded in it, including the date and time it was taken.

But with background uploading turned on, the app will automatically resume unfinished uploads when it detects a significant change in your device's location. This feature is designed to make the Camera Upload feature work more efficiently and does not collect your location information.\nWhen the background uploading option is set to On, you'll see the location services arrow appear at the top of the screen:\nThis icon usually means that an app (such as a mapping app) is using your device's GPS system (if applicable) to keep track of your precise location—and eating up a lot of battery in the process.

However, a couple of notes on usability:\nThe Dropbox app is not designed to be a fully-featured media player, so if you're playing items from a folder of audio files, it will not progress automatically to the next file\nPlayback will also stop if the app is open and you load a different file or exit from the playback screen\nWhen the app is open, you can use the scrubber to fast forward or rewind. From the lock screen on your device, you can use the controls in the Control Center to fast forward and rewind the item you are playing. You won't be able to skip to the next audio item here.\n:subtitle: Can I play Dropbox media files when I'm offline?\nThe media player in the Dropbox application uses the Dropbox servers to stream and transcode media. If you're offline, Dropbox will default to Apple's media player. This means that non-native files (those not filmed or recorded on an iOS device) may not play in our application when you're offline.\n:subtitle: What happens when I make a file available offline?\nWhen you make a file available offline, it is stored locally on your device. For non-native file types, you can open them in another application that supports those file types. Alternatively, there are other third party applications that can convert files to natively play back on iOS devices.\n:subtitle: Learn more\nIn cases where you may need to convert a video file to an iOS-friendly format, we recommend the free Handbrake desktop application (for Windows, Mac, and Linux). Handbrake has convenient video presets for converting video files for the iPhone or iPad. Read Handbrake's online documentation for detailed information about its presets and how to use them.\nWhen converting using something other than iTunes or the Handbrake presets mentioned above, you'll need to meet specific criteria. The Dropbox app can play the following iOS-compatible movie types:\nH.264 video, up to 1.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Low-Complexity version of the H.264 Baseline Profile with AAC-LC stereo audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, in .mov, .mp4 and .m4v file formats\nH.264 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Baseline Profile up to Level 3.0 with AAC-LC stereo audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, in .mov, .mp4 and .m4v file formats\nMPEG-4 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Simple Profile with AAC-LC stereo audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, in .mov, .mp4 and .m4v file formats"},{"title":"Will my Dropbox Business subscription renew automatically  Dropbox","body":":title: Will my Dropbox Business subscription renew automatically? – Dropbox\nDropbox Business subscriptions automatically renew either monthly or annually.

This article details how to enable eduGAIN- or InCommon-supported SSO for your Dropbox Business account.\n:subtitle: What is InCommon and eduGAIN?\neduGain describes itself as \"…a global interfederation service that interconnects multiple identity federations, both technically and legally. It allows a user from one identity federation to access services in another identity federation.\" (Source)\nInCommon Federation, commonly shortened to InCommon, is a framework for trustworthy shared management of access to online resources. It is specific to the US market.\nInCommon is often confused as an identity provider (IdP). In reality, InCommon is a protocol that your IdP may support to provide specific security enhancements to abide by the InCommon Standard.\nThe Dropbox version of single sign-on (SSO) abides by both the eduGAIN and InCommon frameworks.\n:subtitle: How do I enable supported SSO with eduGAIN or InCommon?\nIf you're a Dropbox Education admin, contact your account team and request that they turn on the required eduGAIN or InCommon attribute setting.
