# Motion Starter Kit

This is a bootstrap repo for creating modern web apps.

It's based on our companies structure, simplified down to show all the
patterns we use without doing anything extra.

What you get:

- A mono-repo architecture, so you can import & share common patterns easily
- A [motion](https://github.com/motion/motion) powered app for fast builds & HMR
- [Gloss](https://github.com/motion/gloss) for extremely powerful & easy styling
- A set of mobx helpers, already glued together
- A set of common patterns that make apps easy:
  - Shared `decorators` for views and stores
  - Injected App store that lets you debug stores
  - A simple, easily swapped mobx router

## TODO

- Add horizon/rethinkdb + docker setup + scripts
- Add models via motion-model
