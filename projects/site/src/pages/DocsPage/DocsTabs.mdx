<IntroText>
  Tabs are useful when you aren't using a Grid layout, and want to show content that's hidden behind
  it's own interface.
</IntroText>

The `<Tabs />` component works together with `<Tab />` to make it really easy to show content inside
a list of tabs.

## Examples

### Controlled

You can have Tabs control their contents automatically. In this use case, you just put the content
for each tab into the actual `<Tab>` children property.

<Example id="Controlled" />

### Uncontrolled

Alternatively, if you want to show your tabs in a different location of the interface from where you
want to show the actual Tab chrome, you can separate the two and manage it using some state.

<Example id="Uncontrolled" />
