A `<Table />` is the highest level and most powerful table view in the interface kit.
It is virtualized by default, but acts almost entirely like a non-virtualized table.
It has many features built-in, including:

- Sorting, filtering, searching, and grouping through `useFilter()` props
- Selections and multi-selections through `useSelection()` props
- Display with titles, padding, elevation and more through `<Section />` props
- Sharing to the [Share menu]() through `shareable` prop.
- Keyboard navigation through the `Shortcut` store.
