A `<DefinitionList />` is a simple way to show strucured key/value-like data. Becuase it accepts
similar props to `<Table />` and `<List />`, it's very easy to move your view data between these
views.

That means Definition Lists accept the `rows` and `columns` props, though the `columns` prop is
optional and will be automatically guessed based on the keys of the rows.

Definition Lists use a `<DefinitionItem />` to render each item.

To use a DefinitionList:

```tsx
import { DefinitionList } from '@o/ui'
```
