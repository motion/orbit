title: UI for download project as image
author: Nick Cammarata
integration: github
type: issue
text: We’ve heard feedback that it’s confusing how you can download the current workspace as an image. It’s currently available in the file menu under a sub-option, but perhaps we should make it a higher level button above the editor.

  - export image
  - user interface for downloading project
