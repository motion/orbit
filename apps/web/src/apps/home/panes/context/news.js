I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the\nJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between\nYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral\nCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\nfall, though.\n\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).\n\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\n\n>\n>The first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created\n>in His image, so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever\n>moral code He follows as part of trying to live up to that image.  If we\n>are supposed to live by Christ's example, you would be hard pressed to\n>argue that God is a \"do what I say, not what I do\" kind of guy.\n\nThe trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \"created\nin His image\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and\nhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if\none wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors\nunashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about\nJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives\nby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.\nRevelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse.\n\nThis is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way\ninitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible\nto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where\nFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.\n\n>\n>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no\n>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.\n\nNo. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\nyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\nas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:\n\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\nAs they swam its clearness through.\n\n", "From: rodc@fc.hp.com (Rod Cerkoney)\nSubject: *$G4qxF,fekVH6\nNntp-Posting-Host: hpfcmrc.fc.hp.com\nOrganization: Hewlett Packard, Fort Collins, CO\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8.5]\nLines: 15\n\n\n\n--\n\n\nRegards,\nRod Cerkoney\n                                                        /\\\n______________________________________________         /~~\\\n                                                      /    \\\n  Rod Cerkoney MS 37     email:                      /      \\ \n  Hewlett Packard         rodc@fc.hp.com        /\\  /        \\  \n  3404 East Harmony Rd.

Both the \"External Tank\" and\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\noptions list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\nthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\n\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\ntoday's Times).\n\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\noption are:\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's\n     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\n     for the Air Force.\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\n     source for 30 day missions.\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\n     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\n     add another 20 kW of power\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\n     Vehicle).\n\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\nhave all come to know and love :)\n\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\n\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\n     it visits.\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\n \n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\nto handle your account.\n \n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\nbut cancel you after that.\"\n \n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\n \n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\n \nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\ntheft.\n \n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\n \n \n \n \n \n======================================================================== 32\n \nI live in Idaho.

(There's a gripe in the industry\nthat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's\nmore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system\nas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  \n\n       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\nusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\nway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\nrather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal \npollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  \n\n       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is \npurified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when\nthe water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than \ncooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn Nagle\n", "From: r4938585@joplin.biosci.arizona.edu (Doug Roberts)\nSubject: Re: NL vs. AL?\nOrganization: University of Arizona, Biotechnology, Tucson\nLines: 2\nNNTP-Posting-Host: joplin.biosci.arizona.edu\nKeywords: Game length\n\nDoug Roberts - Ken Hill for NL MVP!!\n\t       Let's go 'Spos\n", "From: jonh@david.wheaton.edu (Jonathan Hayward)\nSubject: Re: Pantheism & Environmentalism\nOrganization: Wheaton College, IL\nLines: 46\n\nIn article <Apr.5.23.31.36.1993.23919@athos.rutgers.edu> by028@cleveland.freenet.edu (Gary V.

Furthermore, its promotion as\nproviding greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far\nas it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal\nof letting LE wiretap \"terrorists and drug dealers\" is to restrict\nstronger techniques.  \n\nWiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or\n(the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be\ntapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption\nclass is merged into the weak-encryption class.

It\nis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On\nthe other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the\nyears.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\n\nI've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\n\nMost revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight.\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\ninto that category.\n\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's \"The Semi\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"\n\nIn general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\n\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\nisn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.\n\nFor myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\n\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\nRuger or Smith revolver....

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in\nthe 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched\nseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part\nin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has\npitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest\non the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!\n\nIt doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while\nThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next\nbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at\n.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team\nis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game\nand giving up 6.6/game. \n\nStill, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should\ncome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave\nthe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, \nFetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be\nsuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either\nheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,\nthe defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen\nis a big question mark.\n\nIn other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William\nSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal.

Cassini is a joint\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's\n    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.\n\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\n    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\n\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\n    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings.

The primary objective of the\n    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global\n    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially\n    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\n\n\n    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over\n    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\n\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft\n    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\n\n    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\n    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see\n    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for\nother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy\nand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were\nkilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions \nlying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,\npeaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to\nmind...\n\nI agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers\nof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally\nintended for.\n\nThat doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is\njust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in\nthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in\nreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many\npeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own\nstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to\nkill by their leaders.\n\nThe point is that there are many things involved in religion that often\nlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant\nside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching\nbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  \n\n@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest\nparts of Man's history.@\n\nAtheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological\nsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.\nThe overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups\nwith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to\nfurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these\nwere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious\npersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more\npowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples\nbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over\nreligion that he does not have many choices.\n\nWell, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of\nlittle silver butter-dishes.\n\n-ciao\n\n-chris blask\n", "From: suresh@pa.dec.com (Suresh Balasubramanian)\nSubject: *****Twin Size Mattress/BoxSprng/Frame for SALE $75*****\nOrganization: Digital Equipment Corporation\nLines: 29\nDistribution: ba\nNNTP-Posting-Host: tmax4.pa.dec.com\n\n\n!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-!-*-!-*-!-!-*-!-*!\n\n\tTwin Size - Mattress, Box Spring and Frame for SALE.\n\n\t** Medico-Pedic [type of mattress?]\n\t** Excellent condition\n        ** 2 yrs old\n\t** Well maintained\n\t\n\t-- You come and pick it up, stuff is located in PaloAlto\n\n\tAsking for: $75\n\n\n\tContact:\n\n\t\tSuresh\n\t\t(415)-617-3522 [W]\n\t\t(415)-324-9553 [H]\n\t\tE-Mail: suresh@pa.dec.com\n\n\n!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-*-!-!-*-!-*-!-!-*-!-*!\n-- \n      o o o o o o o . . .   ______________________________ _____=======_||____\n    o      _____           ||Suresh Balasubramanian      | |suresh@pa.dec.com|\n  .][__n_n_|DD[  ====_____  |Digital Equipment Corp.     | | (415) 617-3522  |\n >(________|__|_[_________]_|____________________________|_|_________________|\n", "From: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)\nSubject: Re: Jews in LATVIA - some documents\nArticle-I.D.: zuma.9304052018\nReply-To: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)\nDistribution: world\nLines: 407\n\nIn article <C4zvvG.50D@unix.amherst.edu> nwbernst@unix.amherst.edu (Neil Bernstein) writes:\n\n: Pardon me?

In 1941, \nwhile the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration \ncamps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian \nbattalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had \ngrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the\nformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the\nshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the \ncold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.\nAn Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party \nleaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by \nthis, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of \nextermination of the Jews.\n\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\"\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\nexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.\n\nFurthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted\na respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros\nArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided\nto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province\nof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia\nclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia\n(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it\nhad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set\nabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who\ncould be expected to oppose their plans. \n\nOn April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian\nand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British\nplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even \nthough the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over\n60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the \nBritish could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of\nthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier\nin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction\nof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of\nKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded\nby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left \nthe scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few \nEuropeans were present to observe the genocide. One British\nsoldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the\ndisarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. \n\nRawlinson wired to his superiors, \n\n\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in\n independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops \n being without discipline and not being under effective control,\n atrocities were constantly being committed.\" \n\n>Instead, you post more Armenian nonsense:\n\nCome again?\n\n: \"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...\n>(34 lines deleted)\n\nWhy?\n\n: No wonder you are in such a mess.

I do\nnot know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and\nopen hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know\nthat\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\nby the death penalty.\n\nMy understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\nprecedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\n\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\n\n\n> Stuff deleted\n> Also, I think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that\n> Khomeini's fatwa was issued due to the _distribution_ of the book.

If my view is correct, then\n> your viewpoint that Rushdie was sentenced for a \"crime in progress\" is\n> incorrect.\n> \nI would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was\nlevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication\nof the book. However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\nlevelled at people, not books.\n\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\n\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\n\nP.S. I'm not sure about this but I think the charge of \"shatim\" also\napplies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella\nof the \"fasad\" ruling.\n", "From: roby@chopin.udel.edu (Scott W Roby)\nSubject: Re: BATF/FBI Murders Almost Everyone in Waco Today! 4/19\nNntp-Posting-Host: chopin.udel.edu\nOrganization: University of Delaware\nLines: 45\n\nIn article <1993Apr20.195636.17742@guinness.idbsu.edu> betz@gozer.idbsu.edu (Andrew Betz) writes:\n>In article <C5sou8.LnB@news.udel.edu> roby@chopin.udel.edu (Scott W Roby) writes:\n>>>Watch from where?

I don't think it is the\nfunction overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time\nin BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in\nporting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of\ninvalid C++ assumptions.\n\nI have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but\nthe reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in\nwhich static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are\ngetting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the\nowner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all\nother pieces of ctrltest work fine.\n\nTwo other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:\n\n- The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,\n  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ\n  between MSC and BC).\n\n- All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++\n  assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place\n  of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for\n  references).\n\nI am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have\nnot encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope\nthat some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's\nhype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that.\n\n-- \n      If these were my employer's opinions, I wouldn't be posting them.\n###############################################################################\n  \"Whoever said nothing lasts forever was obviously  # R.

It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  \nday.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  \ncan't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  \napplication. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  \nthat caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  \nneed to re-boot.\n\nSome background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  \nfirst got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  \nGPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  \n(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  \nmachine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  \nthe motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  \nthe motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  \nwas told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  \nboard.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  \nSAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  \nfine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.\n\nThe reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  \nrebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  \nthe machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. \n\nI haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  \nthese GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  \nday using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  \nin the sppace of 20 minutes?\n\nWhat can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  \ndiagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  \nproblem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  \nDark, quicken, Paint shop pro.

Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services\nCommittee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list\nignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior\nservice personnel.\n   ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),\nsuggested \"concern that the only plausible alternative is that they\nare intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve\ncomponents from maintaining even today's relatively low level of\nparticipation in their parent service's Total Force of the future.\"\n   He asked the commission \"to remove from consideration all\nlocations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to\nwarrant approval of the requested action.\"\n   \"Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve\ninstallations on this list are large enough to have a significant\nimpact on the community, if closed,\" wrote Hultman.  \"The major\nissue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large\npercentage of the existing locations.\"\n   Hultman reminded the commission, \"The fact that the vast\nmajority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come\nclose to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this\nprocess certainly supports the thesis\" that these actions are\nsimply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and\nMarine Corps Reserve.\n   ROA also noted \"that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of\nNaval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480\nNaval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are\napproved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.\"\n   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging\nfrom South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval\nReserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to\nMissoula and Great Falls.

Automatic setups are fine for simple,\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\nin \"equivalent time\" or in \"real time\" sampling mode (equivalent time\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\n\nIs the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\n\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\nuseful information from a digital scope.

Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is \nthe historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary \nheritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, \neven lunatic. \n\nAnd we still demand:\n\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \ndictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\n\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\nKurdish people;\n\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their\nheinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\n\n4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide \nand Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian \npolitical pressure.\n\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. \n\nNow what would you do? \n\nSource: 'The Sunday Times,' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by \n        Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)\n\n    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.\n\n    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former\nSoviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of\nhundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.\n    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more\nthan 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an\nattack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and\nfeared dead.\n    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending\nthe women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified\nrefugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:\" That's when\nthe real  slaughter began,\" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to\nsurvive. \"The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and\nstarted carving up people with their bayonets and knives.\"\n    \" They were shooting, shooting, shooting\", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who\narrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through\nArmenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed\nin front of her. Her daughter was still missing.\n    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.\n\n    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,\nwere still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their\nwounds or the cold.\n    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in\nAgdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the\nseven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were\nwomen, one shot through the chest at point blank range.\n    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they\nhad 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep\nstab wounds.\n    Nor were they safe in Agdam.

They evidently\n   decided the beemer wasn't worth stealing, but did try the next night to\n   steal a Honda Hurricane 600 parked in the next apartment building.\n   A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops.\n\n\nI know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the\nthings that is really good about BMW bikes.  From all accounts I've\nheard practically no one steals BMWs. Probably it is similar for Moto\nGuzzis and other relative \"exotics\" since there isn't a large demand\nfor parts and the bike would be much easier to track down. It seems\nthat the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes. \n\n--\nJonathan E.

And all for making a quick\nbuck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is\nsignificantly inflated by these \"quacks of a different color\".  In fact, I'd\nsay these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the\ntrue focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus\non these \"quacks\" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search-and-\ndestroy-missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non-\ntraditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients\nthat traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.\n\n\n***************************************************\nNow to make a general comment on many recent posts:\n***************************************************\n\nLately I've seen the word \"quack\" bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or\ndoctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical\nsubject in a civilized manner, all he/she has to do is say \"quack-quack\" and\nsomehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over\non their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach\nyou in medical school - how to throw your authority around?\n\nLet me put it another way to make my point clear:  \"quack\" is a nebulous word\nlacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand.\nThe indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming\nfrom any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real\nscary.\n\nBut what do I know, I've already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in this\nnewsgroup as being 'anal retentive', and 'psychotic'.

I know you are better informed than that.  The US \nhas never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada \nfrom the Cubans\tto protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion \nof a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).  \nVietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess \nwe \"invaded\" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have \ninvaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles \nfor anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from \nSpain.\n\nSo if you mean by the word \"invaded\" some sort of military action where\nwe cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally\n\"invaded\" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation.\n(If some nation \"invades\" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be\ninvading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)

In other words,\na person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and\nCzechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one\nwho would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political \ndissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.\n\n\"Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik,\" you ask?  Well, it depends\non what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over\nfreedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you\nthan life itself; if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than live\nunder a tyrant's heel, then yes, it's \"bad\" to be a peace-nik.\n\nThe problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are\nnot like them to be \"bad\" and \"unconscionable\".  I would not have any\nargument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and\nstayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with \nthe national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to\nlegitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and \nmany times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank\nhypocrisy!)  All to stop we \"warmongers\" who are willing to stand up \nand defend our freedoms against tyrants, and who realize that to do\nso requires a strong national defense.\n\nTime to get off the soapbox now.  :)\n\n[...]\n> --\n> Doug Graham         dgraham@bnr.ca         My opinions are my own.\n\nRegards,\n\nJim B.\n", "From: jodfishe@silver.ucs.indiana.edu (joseph dale fisher)\nSubject: Re: Deification\nOrganization: Indiana University\nLines: 14\n\nIn article <Apr.10.05.30.35.1993.14329@athos.rutgers.edu> HOLFELTZ@LSTC2VM.stortek.com writes:\n>Aaron Bryce Cardenas writes:\n>After all, what does prophesy mean?

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE\n    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly\n    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or\n    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming\n    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.\n\n    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news\n    frequently.\n\n\n    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?\n\n    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks\n    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).\n\n    The \"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\" ASC G&C 2102,\n    says:\n\n\t\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\n\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\n\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\n\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\n\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\n\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\n\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\n\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\n\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\n\tin second stage.\"\n\n    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try\n    to interpret.\n\n    1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\n\n    2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\n\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\n\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\n\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\n\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\tThis causes a little bit of\n\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\n\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\n\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the\n\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\n\n    3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\n\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\n\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\n\tthe case if we didn't roll (\"performance gain\").\n\n    4)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\n\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\n\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\n\tcomplexity\").\n\n    5)\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\n\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\n\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\n\n    6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\n\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\n\n    7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\n\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\n\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\n\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\n\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\n\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\n\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\n\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the\n    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle\n    guy.)\n\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the \"roll\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\n    array.\n\n\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\n\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\n    for these viewers.\n\n    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\n    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.\n\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\n    are not being covered.\n\n\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\n\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\n\n\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\n\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\n\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\n\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\n\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\n\n\tStation    VHF\t   10m\t   15m\t   20m\t  40m\t 80m\n\t------\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\t-----\n\tW6FXN\t 145.46\n\tK6MF\t 145.585\t\t\t 7.165\t3.840\n\tWA3NAN\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\t3.860\n\tW5RRR\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\t3.850\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.340  14.270\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\t3.840\n\tW1AW\t\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\t3.990\n\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\n\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

What Peter says about God is what\nthe Bible says.   \n\n\nConsider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of\nyears, various people come up and testify of their experience with the\nliving God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses,\nonce the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes\nDavid, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King \nNebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes\nNehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent\ntakes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use\nto kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up\ncomes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.\nUp comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS\nagents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years\nwith people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself\n\"I am.\" \n\nWhile you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that\nKing David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known\nMatthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these\npeople are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet\nall of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells\nof his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is\ndifferent, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly\nreveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.\nWhat Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of\nBabylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different\nperspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony\ndares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's\ntestimony, even though different from those prior, consistently\ndescribes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  \n\nNow.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic\non the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  \"I am\".  He has\nrevealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).\nPlease believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.\n\nAre you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? \nAre you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from\nshepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer\nprogrammers, fiction?

I'm sure those of us who have it wish there was a cure, but there\nis not.\n\nMark dubin\nthe ol' professor\n\n", "From: patter@dasher.cc.bellcore.com (patterson,george r)\nSubject: Re: Power, signal surges in home...\nOrganization: Bellcore, Livingston, NJ\nLines: 20\n\nIn article <1993Apr20.232804.24632@mprgate.mpr.ca> vanderby@mprgate.mpr.ca (David Vanderbyl) writes:\n>kludge@grissom.larc.nasa.gov (Scott Dorsey) writes:\n>\n>>My car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it's\n>>astonishingly sensitive to RFI.  \n>\n>Hmmmmm... this has possibilities:\n>If the police are in pursuit of a vehicle, maybe they can bombard it with\n>high energy RFI.  :-)\n\nRight.

Children diagnosed with ADD\n   who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and\n   social skills, which in fact continue to decline.  Of course, the parents\n   who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their\n   children's development.  So much for the value of \"interesting anecdotal\n   results\".

I don't think it\nis a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown\nany signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food.\nShe has always been very calm and dare I say, a neat, smart kid.\n\nThe fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made\nby Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to\nsomething in the coating or the cereals.

I'm not suggesting that you should always\naim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the\nlimits of the machine, you have to go beyond them. \n\nIn any case, for maximum braking, if (as I suggested) you aim to keep\nboth wheels just on the point of sliding, then you'll be doing\nexactly as *you* suggest!!\n\n\n\n\n", "From: guykuo@carson.u.washington.edu (Guy Kuo)\nSubject: Quadra 700 Memory Install FAQ\nOrganization: University of Washington\nLines: 69\nNNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.edu\nSummary: Instructions for Quadra 700 memory installation\nKeywords: memory,quadra,700,install\n\nThis is turning into a FAQ\n\n\nHere is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own\nmemory.\n\n1)  Insert usual disclaimer here\n \n2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\n    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back\n\tof the mac.\n \n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\n    need release.\n \n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\n    slots.\n\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\n\tchips facing the front of the motherboard.\n\t\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\n\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\n\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\n\t\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n\t\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\n    DRIVE CABLE.\n\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\n\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\n\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\n\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>\n\n", "From: rosa@ghost.dsi.unimi.it (massimo rossi)\nSubject: ide &scsi controller\nOrganization: Computer Science Dep. - Milan University\nLines: 16\n\nhi folks\ni have 2 hd first is an seagate 130mb\nthe second a cdc 340mb (with a future domain no ram)\ni'd like to change my 2 controller ide & scsi and buy\na new one with ram (at least 1mb) that could controll \nall of them\nany companies?\nhow many $?\nand is it possible via hw or via sw select how divide\nthe ram cache for 2 hd?

The noise you hear is due to the momentary\nopening and closing of the path.\n\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristic\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\nthe audio.\n\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\nimpedance.\n\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\n\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \"Make before\nbreak and Vica Versa\" but I haven't seen any of these for years.\n\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\n\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \"optical isolator\".. It consists\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\npassing the audio.  Once again this device in a \"T\" switches the audio.  Varying\nthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and\nyou have a mixer!\n\nLots of luck!\n-- \n73, Tom\n================================================================================\nTom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player.

This is simply what belief means.\n>\n>Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when\n>it comes to their religion. \n\nThis is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was,\ntaught to think. It is the fundamental premis \"A is not not-A\". If a thing\nis true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic \nasumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We\nshould distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \"believe\",\nhowever. The weak sense means I am not sure. \"I believe Tom went to \nthe library.\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense\nmeans I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \"I believe \nthat nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\" (despite \nthe fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian\nbelief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs\nof the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological \ntopics.)\n \n>Some take it to the extreme and say that\n>their religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings\n>then you won't be \"saved\". \n\nNote that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the \nmajority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that\nif Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be\nfalse, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity. \n(And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)\n \n>It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim\n>to know what God thinks/wants. \n\nIt is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless \nthey have told you.

If I believe Tom is six feet\ntall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we \nmay both be right.

Saying that the glass \nis half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half\nfull: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole\npoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist\nand the optimist express the *same* fact.)\n \nIt is, of course, quite true that different people may express the \nsame belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail\nto understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief\nand may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great\nscisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has\nbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal\nagreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs\nare equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict\nsome other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations\nof language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have\nbeen stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must,\n**necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical\nto say so.

When\nI do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience, \nbecause it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see\nthe results in the long term, I find that He has led me\nin the proper direction, even though it did not feel right\nat the time.  This is where our works as Christians are\nimportant:  As exercises of the body make the body strong,\nexcercises of faith make the faith strong.  \n\n\tAs for you, no one can \"convert\" you.  You must\nchoose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to\nfollow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with\nyou the love we have received from God.  If you reject that,\nwe have to accept your decision, although we always keep\nthe offer open to you.  If you really want to find out\nwhy we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try\npraying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians\nabout their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to\nunderstand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the\nlogic of this world.\n\n\tMay the Lord bring peace to you, \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMalcusco         \n", "From: francesca_M._Benson@fourd.com\nSubject: Serdar\nOrganization: 4th Dimension BBS\nLines: 7\nNNTP-Posting-Host: cs.utexas.edu\n\nWhat an anal retentive you are wimp.\n\n********************************************************************\nSystem: fourd.com                                Phone: 617-494-0565\nCute quote:  Being a computer means never having to say you're sorry\n********************************************************************\n\n", "From: bill_paxton@fourd.com\nSubject: Ajerk\nOrganization: 4th Dimension BBS\nLines: 7\nNNTP-Posting-Host: cs.utexas.edu\n\nYou a good case for rights to abortion.\n\n********************************************************************\nSystem: fourd.com                                Phone: 617-494-0565\nCute quote:  Being a computer means never having to say you're sorry\n********************************************************************\n\n", "Organization: University of Maine System\nFrom: <IO21087@MAINE.MAINE.EDU>\nSubject: Grateful Dead?\nLines: 15\n\nBeing a baseball fan and a fan of the above mentioned band I was\nwondering if anyone could clue me in on whether the Dead (or members\nof) sang the national anthem at todays Giant opener?\n\nI would imagine that it is a bit too early for anyone to know, but\nan answer would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n             Curious,\n                   Robert\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nROBERT MARGESSON                                   UMAINE HOCKEY\n156 PARK ST.

If so, just how 'open' does it\nhave to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What\nif one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also,\nis there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,\nperiod? \n\nQuestion #2\n\nAs I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.\nIs there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if\nyou were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting\nin your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending \ntrial for the shooting?\nAlso, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled\nshotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, \neither that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  \nOne more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being\nrich or famous or related to the mayor?\n\nPlease send replies via E-Mail, as things seem to be piling up around t.p.g\na little faster than I can handle.

There were 21 cases of civilians killing their \nattacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that\n0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every\ncase you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence\nwhere the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed.\n(0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure,\nbased on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000\ncrimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other \nstudies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000.\nThose figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences\ninvolve killing the attacker.) \n\nSo, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000) \ncases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted\nin the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in\ncomparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides\nmake up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study\nconsidered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides\nprevented and 592 homicides.

This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\n\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\n\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\n\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\nEvangelical Churches.\n\n[...]\n\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\nMonophysitism.\n\nPeace,\n\nNabil\n\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\n    '-------------------------------------------------------------'\n\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\nheretical probably aren't.\n\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\nrejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\nthe Antiochene tradition.\n\n--clh]\n", "From: gomer+@pitt.edu (Richard J Coyle)\nSubject: Re: How difficult is it to get Penguin tickets?\nOrganization: University of Pittsburgh\nLines: 14\n\nIn article <1993Apr18.201811.28965@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu> dmoney@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Dean R Money) writes:\n>The subject line says it all.

But this\nstrategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not\nin the near term.)\n\nIn other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence\ninadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to\ninterpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised\nthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything\nbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.\n\nNote that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically\nfeasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without\nwarrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,\nstart surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,\ndecrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation\ngets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.\n\nWhile I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this\narchiving scenario to extremes, read \"Lacey and his Friends\", a\ncollection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the\nslippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it's\nstored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can\nget to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major\nstreets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and\nteller machines, don't we?\n\nAnd then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public\nplaces.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever\nto be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy\ncubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and\nafter.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't\ncurtailed any rights, not really.

Very little acne as a teenager. I\ndidn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it\nreally only gets miserable pimples when it's dry. \n\nFrequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp\nthing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under\nthe bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day\nvitamin/mineral might help.

I notice grease \non my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating\nmeat).\n\nKeeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help.

Andrew Byler)\nSubject: The Nicene Creed (was Re: MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY)\nOrganization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA\nLines: 152\n\nMichael Bushnell writes;\n\n>The so-called Creed of Athanasius, however, has always been a Western\n>creed, and has always had the filioque.  The Orthodox have said that\n>they accept all that it says, with the exception of the filioque, but\n>it is not \"in use.\"\n\nWhich is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use\nof the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it\nsaid the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that\nhas changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the\nNicene - Constantinopolitan did not.\n\tOf course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene\nCreed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the\nAthanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.\n\tI might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in\nways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East\nemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father\nthrough the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the\nSon.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see\nbelow)\n\n\t\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do\ncall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the\nroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the\nriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,\nbut coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must\nnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on\nthat account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there\nare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is\nthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\"\n\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\n\nand\n\n\t\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father\nthrough the Son\"\n\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\n\nAnd as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,\nArticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\nemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit\nproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in\na more preeminent way.\n\n\t\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both.\"\n\t-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\n\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\nmention of the Son being necessary.\n\tIn any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\nposition, which I enunciated above.\n\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \"to produce,\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\nthe Fathers of Nicea.\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\n\n\t\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\nfrom it.\"\n\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\n\n\t\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone\nloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again it\nis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he\nis none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the\nHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,\nthat the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shall\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.'\"\n\t-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)\n\n\t\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the\nappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to\nthe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the\nFather,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `will\nreceive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the\nSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit\ndivine, ... of God, and He is God.

I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not\nseen it myself).\n\n  Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which\nonly three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5\nlibraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the\nvendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same\nproblem when X11R6 becomes available.\n\n  The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do\nnot have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif,\nbut that sort of ruins the whole idea of \"free\", doesn't it?\n\n    Cheers,\n\n    Tom McConnell\n-- \n Tom McConnell          |     Internet: tmcconne@sedona.intel.com\n Intel, Corp.

It is interesting\nmedically because the normal location of organs is caused in part\nby the \"normal\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in\nabsence of this, laterality can be \"random.\" People with situs\ninversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their\nrarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they\ncan't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong\nside). \n\nAccording to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal\nrecessive, which should imply that on average one child in four\nin a family would be affected. But there may be much more current\ninformation on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking\nabout more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask your\npediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of\nwhich there is probably one at NCSU.\n\n-km\n", "From: hsieh@ipld04.hac.com (Julia Hsieh)\nSubject: How to reach Micron\nDistribution: na\nLines: 15\n\n\nDoes anyone know how to reach Micron?

Where I'm not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\nexceptional cases (\"valid but irregular\").

It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at\n65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be\nable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)\nand a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be\ncheap.  \n\nMy first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\n\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\ncircuit would not detect it.   \n\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In\nfact the difference between completely black and completely white is\nonly 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the\nvideo signals to make this work.  \n\nThere are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require \nsplit supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator\nwith three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply\ncircuit.  \n\nAt this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor\ncircuit.

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\n\n\n\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\n\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\n\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\nwe brought up.\n\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\n\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\nin those sectors.\n\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\n\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\n\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\n\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\nhappen immediatly there.\n\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\nreally did know the answers.\n\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\n\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\n\n\t\t\tJohn.\n", "From: bontchev@fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de (Vesselin Bontchev)\nSubject: Re: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption\nReply-To: bontchev@fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de\nOrganization: Virus Test Center, University of Hamburg\nLines: 19\n\nmathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk> writes:\n\n> bena@dec05.cs.monash.edu.au (Ben Aveling) writes:\n> > Don't forget, you are in the country that wouldn't let the Russians\n> > buy Apple II's because of security concerns.\n\n> That's nothing.

Metzger)\nSubject: The Escrow Database.\nOrganization: Partnership for an America Free Drug\nLines: 77\n\nHere is a disturbing thought.\n\nNow, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in\nthe electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database\nget? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were\nI an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow\nhouses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)\n\nWell, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of\nserial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but\nthis is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the\npopulation, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for\neach of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very\nvaluable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who\ncares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my\npocket on two 8mm tapes.\n\nAdmittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole\ndatabase on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks\nin the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day\nby hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience\nwill dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At\nsome point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte\ntapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will\ndoubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that \"can't\" is a\nprayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.\n\nWith two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for\nevery person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you\nneed the \"master key\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information\nthat have to be stored an awful lot of places.\n\nCome to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database\nisn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial\npolitical views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the\nones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the\nevil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have\na big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial\nsecrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why\nour companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left\nunexplained by those that point out this threat.) \n\nPresumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA\nand other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened\nmany times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some\nfraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.\n\nDon't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on\nthe escrow databases.\n\nWe crypto types are all taught something very important at the\nbeginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the\neasily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a\nsecret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our\nteachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they\nwould lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million\nClipper chips.\n\nI cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this\ndoesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too\nmany of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect\nthat they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are\ndoing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue\nto surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect\nthat they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can\ntry to delay things as long as possible.\n\nWho knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable\nbureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe\nthat this scheme might give people some security, even as their\nsubordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of\nit all.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger\t\tpmetzger@shearson.com\n--\nLaissez faire, laissez passer.

I'm not\nadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that\nit's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible\nto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often\nuses the term \"second death\".  The most obvious understanding of that\nwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks\nboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms\nthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\nthere's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\nimplies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to \nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\n\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.\n\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\neternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever.\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\nthe devil, and humans?\n\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be\nunderstood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\neternity.\n\n2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\nRevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\nRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,\nit doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says\nthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that \nthere is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people\nare tormented forever.\n\nPsalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.\n\n--clh]\n", "From: klinger@ccu.umanitoba.ca (Jorg Klinger)\nSubject: Re: uh, der, whassa deltabox?\nNntp-Posting-Host: ccu.umanitoba.ca\nOrganization: University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada\nLines: 24\n\nIn <ramarren-150493134758@kops.apple.com> ramarren@apple.com (Godfrey DiGiorgi) writes:\n\n>>Can someone tell me what a deltabox frame is, and what relation that has,\n>>if any, to the frame on my Hawk GT?

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\n6-3 opening victory.\n\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\n\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.\n\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\nSaddledome popcorn.\n\n\"If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I'd be\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\nplayoffs.\"\n\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\n\nWhile insisting he is the Kings' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \nVancouver on Thursday.\n\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\ngreat goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.\"\n\n\"I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\nmore from him than he does.\"\n\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\n\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\n\n\"What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry \ndoesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm\na perfectionist.\"\n\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \neven though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's \na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \nyou're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain \nto him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I \ndo know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.\"\n\nMelrose's \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. \"Before\nyou know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\n\n------\n\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \nChannel 7 here in LA.

Even despite this the House of Lords has\nconsiderable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body. \n\n\n|>       My reading of the Constitution and other writings gives me absolutely\n|>no reason to believe the Senate wasn't intended to make use of their \n|>law-making powers.

You'll note that while the\n|>President's veto may be over-ridden, the House can't do anything about\n|>a \"veto\" by the Senate.\n\nThe Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it\nin a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent\nof being a check on unreasonable legislation. The veto was clearly regarded \nas a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to\npreventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.\n\nthe Senate is not meant to be exactly a rubber stamp body, it is meant as\na check on unrestrained legislation. That is the extra measure built into\nthe constitution in favour of the status quo, 60% of the representatives\nof the states is not a reasonable restriction. \n", "From: wes1574@zeus.tamu.edu (Bill Scrivener)\nSubject: In need of help....\nOrganization: Texas A&M University, Academic Computing Services\nLines: 22\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: zeus.tamu.edu\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    \n\nOk, I have a problem that I thought you guys/gals might know about....\n\nI'm running a 286dx-25 with a 85mb hdd.

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\n\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\nargument.\n\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\nthe right tool for the job.\n\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\n\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\n\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\nthree stages.\n\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \n\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\npremises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious\" when\nyou've heard the explanation.)\n\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\nvalid inference.\n\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\n\"therefore\".\n\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\n\nFor example:\n\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\n\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\n\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \nsometimes a little confusing.\n\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\n\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\n or the Son of God.\"\n\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll\ncome to those later.)\n\nAnother example:\n\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\n\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\nargument.\n\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\nB\".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\nstatement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\n\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\n -- This is an explanation.\n\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\nconclusion is true.\n\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\n\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\n\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\ncarefully.\n\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \nFor example:\n\n   All insects have wings (premise)\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\n\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false. \nIf the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\n\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\nas in:\n\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\n\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\nimplication.\n\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\n\nPremise Conclusion Inference\n   A        B        A=>B\n----------------------------\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\n\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\n\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\n                             the conclusion must be true.\n\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\n\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\n\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\nconvincing.\n\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\nexhaustive.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\n\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\n\nFor example:\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\n\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\n\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\n\nFor example:\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\n\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\n\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\nthe opponent's particular circumstances.\n\nFor example:\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\notherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\n\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\nthe opponent's argument.\n\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \nexample:\n\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \nYou're white.\"\n\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\n\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\n\nExamples:\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\n\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\n\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\n\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\nsuch flood occurred.\"\n\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\nhowever.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\n\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \nconclusion accepted.  For example:\n\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me\nguilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\n\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\n\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\n\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\n\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\n\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\n\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\n\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\nbetween:\n\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\nand\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\n computer\"\n\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\n\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\n\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\nspecific.  For example:\n\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\ndislike atheists.\"\n\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\n\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\n\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\n\nFor example:\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\ninsincere.\"\n\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\n\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\nhasty generalization.\n\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\n\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \nexample:\n\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\ncured me of the headache.\"\n\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \nexample:\n\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\natheism for the same reasons.\"\n\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\n\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\n\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\nconclusion reached.\n\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\n\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\n\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\noffice.\"\n\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\nfor the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees. \nAnother example is the classic:\n\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\n\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\n\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \nquestion:\n\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\n\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\nwhen they ask questions like:\n\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\n\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\n\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\nor\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\n\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\n\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\nwith that conclusion.\n\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\n\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\nfavourable light.\n\nEQUIVOCATION\n\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\n\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\n\nAMPHIBOLY\n\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\n\nACCENT\n\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\n\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\nand\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\n\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\n\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\n\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \nlightweight.\"\n\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\n\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\n\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\n\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\n\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\n\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\neach item.  For example:\n\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\n\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\n\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\nfirst event.\n\nFor example:\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\nand we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\nlegalize marijuana.\"\n\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\n\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\n\nExamples:\n\"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of\nhistory?\"\n\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a\nform of Christianity?\"\n\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?\"\n\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\nimplication given earlier.\n\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\na fallacy.\n\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\nanything about B.\n\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\n\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\nbecause it is old, or because \"that's the way it's always been.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\n\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\nthan something else.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\n\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\n\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\nargumentum ad crumenam.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\n\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\n\nBIFURCATION\n\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\nalternatives exist or can exist.\n\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\n\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\nquestion.\n\nNON SEQUITUR\n\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\n\nRED HERRING\n\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\nbeing discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\n\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\n\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\n\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\n\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\n\nSTRAW MAN\n\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\nmade.\n\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\n\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\n\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \nanti-cryptography legislation:\n\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\n\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\n Martin Luther King.\"\n\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\n\nTU QUOQUE\n\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\n\n\"You're just being randomly abusive.\"\n\"So?  You've been abusive too.\"\n\n\u00ff\n", "From: Kurt Godden <godden@gmr.com>\nSubject: GM May Build Toyota-badged Car\nOrganization: GM R&D\nLines: 13\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: ksg.cs.gmr.com\nX-UserAgent: Nuntius v1.1.1d16\nX-XXMessage-ID: <A7F46B03C301085E@ksg.cs.gmr.com>\nX-XXDate: Fri, 16 Apr 93 13:54:11 GMT\n\nThis appeared today in the \n\nThe Japan Economic Journal reported GM plans to build a Toyota-badged car\nin the US for sale in Japan.

But that is\nonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with\ninjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really\nrather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\ndon't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\nhuman attitudes.  \n\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\n\"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\ngoing to come back with \"winning spirit\" and all of that crap but these\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\na decent living. \n\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\n\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The \nemphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promoted\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\nleague over the year.  They proved it.\n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm\n\n-- \nRoger Maynard \nmaynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca \n", "From: bil@okcforum.osrhe.edu (Bill Conner)\nSubject: Re: Not the Omni!\nNntp-Posting-Host: okcforum.osrhe.edu\nOrganization: Okcforum Unix Users Group\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]\nLines: 18\n\nCharley Wingate (mangoe@cs.umd.edu) wrote:\n: \n: >> Please enlighten me.

Polymenakos) writes:\n\n> Well, ZUMABOT claims just the opposite: That Greeks are not allowing\n>Turks to exit the country. Now, explain this: The number of Turks in\n>Thrace has steadily risen from 50,000 in 23 to 80,000, while the Greeks of\n\nDr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally \nbe believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing \nGoebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks \nwho are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's \ninformed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For \ninstance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they \nwatched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can \nread the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what \nreally happened. \n\nThere are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee \nAlumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, \nthe Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, \nthe Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek \nMen's Lycee Foundation.  \n\nAs for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' \nin titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts \nhave ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\n\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \n\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \naccording to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'\n\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\n\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \nof historical monuments. \n\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \nHellenizing the region.\n\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \nSidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \nand remains without a job. \n\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \nfindings were published in a report titled \n\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\n\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \nLausanne Convention. \n\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in\nKarotas was razed by bulldozers.\n\nShall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going \nto take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The \ndiscussion of human rights violations in Greece does not \nstop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles \nI shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks\nin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.\n\nIt has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration \nhas an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made \nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \nconventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek \nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\n\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\nof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were \ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \nShots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\n  'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited\n  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by\n  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,\n  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).\n\n  pages 82-83:\n\n<< 1. The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus\n   and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered\n   to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their\n   husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age\n   were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst\n   the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a\n   captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities\n   had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.\n\n   2.

The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the\n   following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire\n   and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt\n   end of a gun.\n\n   4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls\n   and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers\n   in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house\n   near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath\n   by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.\n\n   5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and\n   dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then\n   killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been\n   no more heard of.\n\n   6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded\n   by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.\n\n   The Greeks killed also many Jews.

These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British\nsoldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in\nfavor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they\nmassacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing\nto the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their\nvery lives.\n\tI mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part\nJewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the\nIsraelites pisses me off so.

One of his best throwaway lines was to\nremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been\nchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the\npeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of\n\"election fraud\" to hold their jobs.\n\nNancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and\nsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and\ntelling people where to find their own representatives (and in too\nmany cases, who they were).\n\nMike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and\ndiscuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a\ndelegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater\nof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was\nbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or\nammo to anyone who is not a state resident.\n\nThe hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner\nAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's\nhearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive\nhusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole\nour representatives, after which we would be squashed into an\ninadequate hearing room.\n\nOne of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.\nHe said, \"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is\nalways so organized every year.\"  I got a little pissed, and replied,\n\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\"\n\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\npro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\nseveral Simon's Rock anti-gun \"close-the-loophole\" protestors.\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\n\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\n\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\nto \"support GOAL's position\" on \"all bills.\"\n\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \n\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock\nfolks called the current law a \"loophole\" and wanted it closed.\n\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \"SKS assault rifle.\"\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri,\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \"as strong as\"\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.\n\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  \"In some of\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\"\n(Oooooo!)  \"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't\nbe having this situation -- but they won't.\"  (Naughty, naughty!)\n\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert \"Dapper\" O'Neill.  He was\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\njudge, he'd give arrestees their \"last rights\" (pun intended) on the\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\n\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\n\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\nconvicted.\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.\n\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\n\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\ncongressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that\nit's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\n\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\nJujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \"restraining\norder\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \nwas a co-sponsor of one of the \"restraining order\" bills as well.)  One\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \"every\nyear it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\"\nIt's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\nmore effective.\n\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue.\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \"public\"\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\n\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\nquote: \"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\ncomputer system until 1999.\"  (This was also an argument he used\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\n\nTestimony was heard from several \"battered women,\" one of whom had\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\nrambling circumlocution in response.\n\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\n\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\nOne of the junior reps noted that \"this is America\" and we have to be\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\nreiterated this, saying that \"people who abuse smaller people can go\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\nconviction with a restraining order.\"  (Point and match, Senator.)\n\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his\ncitizenship \"expired every 5 years,\" and that a driver's license was a\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, \"I'll make you a deal.  You get\nme the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\"\n\nNext came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \"he\nwouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\noutside\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \"loophole\" should be\nclosed to prevent something like this from \"ever happening again\".\n\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\nsaying, \"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\nsafe -- support gun control.\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \"Only residents can get\nFID's,\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\nout-of-staters completely off?)\n\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\nrecord.\n\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \"elitist\".  Another\n(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\nfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the union\nhad \"FID-type\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home\nstate was \"not enough.\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\n\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\"\n\nAll the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\nother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and\nGOAL's position) were:\n\no  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull \n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\n\no  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\n\no  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\n   opposed)\n\no  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \n   (opposed)\n\no  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\n\no  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)\n\no  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)\n\no  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\n\no  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\n\nSome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\n\nMike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\n\nCaron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\nAgain, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said,\n\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\"\n\nThe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It\nended at about 6:30.\n-- \n\ncdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company,\nOR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors' Packet...\n\n", "From: wongda@eecg.toronto.edu (Daniel Y.H.

In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\n\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\nthink of epistemology as \"how do you know?\"  That question, it turns out, is\na very troubling one.\n\nThe problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\n\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\n\n\nLet's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional\nInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of\nPapal Infallibility, too.)\n\nZeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and\nseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and\npossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute\nTruth.\n\nHe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\nHis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made\nmistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\nmistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)\n\nEverything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that\nhappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what\nhe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own\ninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own\nreasoning, that belief cannot be considered \"absolutely certain\".\n\nZeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief\nis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can\nsay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.\n\nAny belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on\nyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible\nthinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.\n\n\nThis is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing\nepistemology: \"how do you know?\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:\n\n A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.\n\n B: How do you know?\n\n A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church\n    teachings and came to this conclusion.\n\n B: How do you know you studied history correctly?\n\n A: Well, I double-checked everything.\n\n B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?\n\n A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.\n\n B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is\n    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?\n\n A: ...\n\nAnd, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \"I\ncan't prove that there are no mistakes\" -- and as long as you may have made a\nmistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.\n\nThere is no way out of the loop.\n\n\nThis is where the \"arrogance of Christians\" arises: many people believe\nthat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the\ndoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are\ninfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.\n\nClaiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led\nyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.\n\n *\n\nPeople who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to\nfind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking\nthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),\nbut the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is\nknowably Inerrant.\n\n\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n\"At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded.\"\n                                                    -- Ludwig Wittgenstein\n", "From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D.

Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can't wear out       |\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\n| '88 K75S  '48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\n| '75 R90S(#151) '72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They're built like rocks |\n| '65 R50/2/Velorex  '57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It's the Harleys that     |\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n", "From: david@terminus.ericsson.se (David Bold)\nSubject: Re: Question for those with popular morality\nReply-To: david@terminus.ericsson.se\nDistribution: world\nOrganization: Camtec Electronics (Ericsson), Leicester, England\nLines: 50\nNntp-Posting-Host: bangkok\n\nPaul Hudson Jr (hudson@athena.cs.uga.edu) writes:\n\n>I was not directly going to come up with a moral argument for the  existence\n>of God.

In fact, for the Bible to be of\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\n\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of\nIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial\nLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance\nof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.\n\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\nwritten down by man.\n\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\nhave done).\n\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\nthink the important aspect is the result.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:\n\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\nAs they swam its clearness through.\n\n", "From: ezzie@lucs2.lancs.ac.uk (One of those daze...)\nSubject: Borland turbo C libraries for S3 graphics card\nOrganization: Lancaster University Computer Society\nLines: 5\n\nI've recently got hold of a PC with an S3 card in it, and I'd like to do some\nC programming with it, are there any libraries out there that will let me\naccess the high resolution modes available via Borland Turbo C?\n\n\tAndy\n", "From: swh@capella.cup.hp.com (Steve Harrold)\nSubject: Re: Need Info on Diamond Viper Video Card\nOrganization: Hewlett Packard, Cupertino\nLines: 46\n\nExperiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card\n\nSeveral problems:\n\n1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB\n   of VRAM, which is what I have.

How do I become an astronaut?\n\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\n    specialist\".\n\n    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\tIt is not enough\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\n\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\n\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\t(DO NOT get a\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\n    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.\n\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\n    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\n    Keep your nose clean.\n\n    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\n\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".\n\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\n    to demonstrate motivation.\n\n    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.\n\n\n\n\n    NASA\n    National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center\n    Houston, Texas\n\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\n    ==================================================================\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ---------------------------\n\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\n\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\n    considered.\n\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\n    program.\n\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\n    ---------------------------------\n\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\n    flight crew.\n\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\n    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\n    government agencies and private industries.\n\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\n    astronauts.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut\n\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\n    payload operations.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\n\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\n    experimental operations.\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ===========================\n\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\n    --------------------------------\n\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\n    submitting an application.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\n\n    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,\n    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be\n    substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's\n    degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic\n    preparation is important.\n\n    2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a\n    civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n\t Distant visual acuity:\n\t      20/150 or better uncorrected,\n\t      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\n\n\t Blood pressure:\n\t      140/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidate:\n\n    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,\n    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of\n    academic preparation is important.\n\n    2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight\n    test experience highly desirable.\n\n    3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a\n    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n\t Distant visual acuity:\n\t      20/50 or better uncorrected\n\t      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\n\n\t Blood pressure:\n\t      140/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.\n\n    Citizenship Requirements\n\n    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of\n    the United States.\n\n    Note on Academic Requirements\n\n    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic\n    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --\n    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum\n    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's\n    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,\n    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.\n\n      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the\n    sciences, are not considered qualifying:\n      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,\n\tMedical Technology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological\n\tPsychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).\n      - Degrees in Nursing.\n      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.\n\n    Application Procedures\n    ----------------------\n\n    Civilian\n\n    The application package may be obtained by writing to:\n\n\tNASA Johnson Space Center\n\tAstronaut Selection Office\n\tATTN: AHX\n\tHouston, TX 77058\n\n    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\n\n    Active Duty Military\n\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\n\n    Selection\n    ---------\n\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\n\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\n    their establishment.\n\n    General Program Requirements\n\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\n    their candidate period.\n\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\n    specified tour of duty.\n\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\n\n    Pay and Benefits\n    ----------------\n\n    Civilians\n\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\n    and experience.\n\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\n\n    Military\n\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\n    other similar military matters.\n\n\nNEXT: FAQ #15/15 - Orbital and Planetary Launch Services\n", "From: lynch@hpcc01.corp.hp.com (Howard Lynch)\nSubject: Re: PHILLIES SIGN MARK DAVIS\nOrganization: the HP Corporate notes server\nLines: 8\n\nI had heard the rumors about LA, Cin, Hou, and SD all being\ninterested in Mark Davis, so it doesn't surprise me that a\nteam had to give up something and cash to actually get him.\n\nLynch \"MOB\"\n\nps.  anyone else draft this guy?  i really did and got a \n     loud cry of \"when will you ever give up on this guy\" :-)\n", "From: tomacj@opco.enet.dec.com (THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO !!!)\nSubject: MR2 - noisy engine.\nOrganization: Digital Equipment Corporation\nLines: 19\nNNTP-Posting-Host: OPCO\n\n\nG'day people,\n\t\n\tAre there any MR2 owners or motor-head gurus out there, that know why\nmy MR2's engine sounds noisy?

I don't feel compelled to\ndiscuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would\nnot have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating would\nnot have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call\nto make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.  \n\n      I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive than\nme using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner.

But to suggest that a\n*disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is \ntaking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease\nfor lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed\nblindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare\nsay all of us would be walking into walls.\n>\n>I wonder if AIDS would be a problem now if people didn't get\n>involved in deviant sexual behaviour. Certainly, people who\n>received tainted blood are not to blame. But it just goes\n>to show that all mankind is affected by the actions of a few.\n\nYes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real*\ncareful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for \nsin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the\nresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was\nblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any\nother STD is a *punishment\" for sexual sin, what do we do with \ndiseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as\ndebilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a\nspecific behavior or lifestyle?\n>\n>In addition, IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things.\n>There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS ?\n>I don't know.\n\nAtonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark\nabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.\nThe atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central\nmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,\nand was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of\nour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for\nour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He\nhas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or \nsome other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting\non the sacrifice that Jesus made.\n\nIn case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when\nI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\nphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\nsocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,\nno more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think\nit's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus\nhealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on\nthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.\nShe has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed \nrelationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be,\nbut God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining\nweight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is\nexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes\nher improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who\nare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It\nseems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.\n\nPaul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I \nthink applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I\n(or something like that).\n\nMay we all experience and accept God's grace.\n>\n>-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>Mark Ashley                        |DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed\n>marka@gcx1.ssd.csd.harris.com      |here are my own; they do not\n>..!uunet!gcx1!marka               |reflect the opinion or policies\n>The Lost Los Angelino              |of Harris Corporation.\n>-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n===============================================================================\nPaul Conditt\t\tInternet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu\nApplied Research\tPhone:\t  (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259\n  Laboratories\t\tFedex:\t  10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423\nUniversity of Texas\tPostal:\t  P.O.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-\nwork, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the\nNagorno Karabagh region.\n\nAfter the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically\nin Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \"uprising\" in\nAzerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a \ndemonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the \nZhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even \nwomen; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, \nand went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There\nwere some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the\nArmenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.\nI was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew \nwouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really \nbad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,\n\"There's unrest everywhere, be careful.\" Well I had a project going on. I told\nthe Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on \nand said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they \nsaid, \"Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the \npolice, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\" \nWell, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he \nknows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This\nman didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and \nafterward he spent the night with us, too.\n\nI sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \"The situation is\nvery tense, be careful.\"\n\nWe finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the\nmorning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I\nshouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's\nbusiness travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it \nand my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, \nthey sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that\nthey had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out \nthey knew what was happening in Sumgait.\n\nI arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is\nclosed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the \nbuses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two\nminutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private\ndrivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \"Let's go find some other way to get\nthere.\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to\ntake us to Sumgait.\n\nHe took us there. But the others had said, \"I wouldn't go if you gave me a\nthousand rubles.\" \"Why?\" \"Because they're burning the city and killing the\nArmenians. There isn't an Armenian left.\" Well I got hold of myself so I could\nstill stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we \nset off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \"In fact there aren't any\nArmenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\" Well \nI was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, \n\"How old are you, old man?\" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not \nsaying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. \"How old are you?\" he asks \nme. I say, \"I'm 47.\" \"I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'.\" I say, \"It \ndepends on God, each person's life in this world is different.\" I look much\nolder than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was\nsilent, too.\n\nWe're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.\nBefore we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he\nwas waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with\nthem, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant\nthere were no Armenians with us.\n\nI look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the \nstreet, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They\nstopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature \nshafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .\n\nAlong the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's \nnot. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak \ntheir language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for \n\"nut,\" or \"little nut,\" as \"pundukh,\" but \"fundukh\" is actually correct. The \npronunciations are different. Anyone who says \"pundukh,\" even if they're not \nArmenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, \n\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\" he says. \"They started \nhitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the\npeople out,\" he says, \"they wouldn't let them get out of the car.\" I only saw \nthe car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from\nBaku to Sumgait and back . . .\n\nWhen they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy,\nhis eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in\nthe other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \"We're\nAzerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here.\" He did come up to me when \nwe were pulling our things out and says, \"Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?\" \nBut in Azerbaijani I say, \"You should be ashamed of yourself!\" And . . . he \nleft. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had \nto . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own \nhome.\n\nThey stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store \nand three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I \nsaw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I \ncouldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it \nwas a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing \nremained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I\nsaw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About\n30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.\n\nI see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are\nclosed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the\ncrowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots.\nSeveral shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. \nSomeone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the \nsoldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one \narmored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning \noff Sumgait.\n\nI walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by \ntheir gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I\njoined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us\nand asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.\nBut I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly \nrecognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer\npeople. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.\nI can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as \nto get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking \nbehind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: \"Comrades, the Armenian-\nAzerbaijani war has begun!\"\n\nThe police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around \nthe second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off \nbehind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, \nand inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every\ncorner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were \ndoing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But \nthe most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least\nfind out if my children were alive or not . . .\n\n   April 20, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Our Lutheran parish just\ninstituted the \"Tenebrae\" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for \na paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things\nthat I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those \"facts\" were\nalways there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about\nthe differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over\nbreakfast Easter Sunday.\n>\n>   As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem\n>is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of\n>innovations.  The priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any\n>decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it's easier to \"try\n>something new\" than it is to refuse to allow it.\n\nMy wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music\nand worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee\nbut listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions.  It needs a strong\nhand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong\nas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional\nreason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual\nguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA \"wishy-washy\".\n \nAs you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-\nregardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes\nthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a\ntraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament\nof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.\nThe reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings\nare not shared by everyone.\n\nI want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want \nthem attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful\nservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of\nWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such\nas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it\nis Not there.\n\nQuite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and \"fit in\".\nMy dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils\nwould intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who\nhave beared with me this far understand what I mean.\n\nPlease keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not\nto worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something\nwrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or\npastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn't listen.  They are there to \nprovide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with\nthe Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change\nfaiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and\nministers.\n\nIn Christ,\nKershner\n-- \nKershner Wyatt\nkwyatt@ccscola.ColumbiaSC.ncr.com\n\nMy opinions are my own and aren't necessarily my employer's.\n", "From: jlevine@rd.hydro.on.ca (Jody Levine)\nSubject: Re: Wanted: Advice for New Cylist\nOrganization: Ontario Hydro - Research Division\nLines: 18\n\nIn article <C5r7Ey.7Mq@srgenprp.sr.hp.com> blaisec@sr.hp.com (Blaise Cirelli) writes:\n>\n>I'm thinking of buying a motorcycle.

And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.\n\nFor example, I recently was asking some children the question \"What temperature\ndoes water boil at?\"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked\nif they knew what scale, and was told \"It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale.\nThat's what all thermometers say.\"  Well, that's sincere, and may be\ntrue in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT\nan absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should\nnurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth\nand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time\nand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion\neasily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of \nthe indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.\n \n[example of head-covering in Church deleted]\n\nThis was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the\nwriting, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the\ninstructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.\nThe instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first\ncentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having\na LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I \nsee no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.\n \n>Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture \n>to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)\n>Can you reconcile this?\n\nEven the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.\nI've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse \"blessed is he who takes your\nbabies and smashes their heads against the rocks\" literally.  The Bible\nwas not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us\nwhat parts should be interpreted which way. \n \n>> Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.

And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be \nable to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.\nThe presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I\nknow I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.\n>\n>> >There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical \n>> >Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding \n>> >Biblical interpretation.\n>> \n>> So?

I can only rely upon MY experience.\nI also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite.\nTherefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.  \nI can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which\nGod is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE\nabsolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the\noriginal scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell.\nWho cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as \nwell believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they\nlive on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on \nhow I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that\ncafeteria for lunch?  No.  \n\nThis attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians\nare arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true,\nwonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner\nreflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply\nappear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.\n\nNOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.\n       There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.\n       Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.\n       Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,\n       and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.\n       Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few \n       adults respond to this treatment.\n\nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n-- \n-------\nLawrence Overacker\nShell Oil Company, Information Center    Houston, TX            (713) 245-2965\nllo@shell.com\n", "From: halat@pooh.bears (Jim Halat)\nSubject: Re: After 2000 years, can we say that Christian Morality is\nReply-To: halat@pooh.bears (Jim Halat)\nLines: 45\n\nIn article <1r3qab$o1v@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de>, frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer) writes:\n>In article <930421.102525.9Y9.rusnews.w165w@mantis.co.uk> mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk> writes:\n>#frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer) writes:\n>#> In article <930420.100544.6n0.rusnews.w165w@mantis.co.uk> mathew\n>#> <mathew@mantis.co.uk> writes:\n>#> #This is complete nonsense.

God may choose one individual over\nanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not\npreclude that the development of that individual into what he is in\nthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.\n\nI do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view\nof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that\nbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater\nlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the\nultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of\nChrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that\nwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the\nflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental\nconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized\nand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus\nChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.\nTheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the\ncontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).\nMore important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,\nthe ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate\nresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.\n\nThere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the\ntenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.\nClearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma\nor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a\nnew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not\nrefute the disciples' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of\ncourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only\none of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man\nhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his\nparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\nChrist's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\n\nThere is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John\nthe Baptist,\n\n   \"If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.\"\n\nThis also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\nthe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\"If\nyou care to accept it\").  So I took care to point out, not that the\nBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I\npointedly used \"repeated earth lives\" to distinguish a little from the\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word \"reincarnation\".\nThe phrase is Rudolf Steiner's (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\nfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing's \"The\nEducation of the Human Race\".\n\nTo return to your original point, Paul's statement about Jacob and\nEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\nAnd both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus\nChrist, in my view.\n\nRegards, \nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\n", "From: npm@netcom.com (Nancy P.

But one obvious reason\nwhy Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with\nhis punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that\nwe would \"stop doubting and believe\" (John 21:27).  The fact\nthat Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise\nfrom the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.\nWithout this obvious point, I would have no hope\nand my faith would be vanity.\n\nWhy did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus\nsays why in John 15:18-25.

If we are going to get anywhere in \nthis (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never \naddressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is \n\"right\" or who is \"wrong\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover \nand that, having been placed \"in between\" the Israelis and the guerillas,\nthey *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.\n \n\t[The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms \n\tis *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that \n\tcivilians will not be thought of by the other side as\n\t\"combatants\". So, what do you think is the \"meaning behind\", \n\tthe intention and the effect when an \"army\" purposely \n\t*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look \n\tlike civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will \n\treceive from this \"cover\" is more important that the harm\n\tthat will come to civilians.*\n\nThis is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying\nthat the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians\nin \"the middle\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart\nfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower\nthe risk to civilians.\n\n\tBut if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves\n\tat greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \"why set \n\tourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made \n\tcover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of \n\tview, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept \n\tsome of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.\n\n> If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working?

BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait \nuntil attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that\n\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\" will do more to stop attacks. \n\nAs I said previously, Israel spent several decades \"sitting passively\"\non its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*\nthe attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well.\nThe \"host\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks \nfrom its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks\nwere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact \non the civilians caught in their path.  \n>\n>|> What?So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states \n>|> can start all over again?

By your\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\n\nThat is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for \nthe \"interim\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\ndemanding conditions that essentially define \"autonomy\" already. They DO\nNOT trust that Israel will \"follow through\" the entire process and allow\nPalestinians to reach full autonomy. \n\nDo you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? \nIf you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians \nbe any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words?\nSince they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \"tangible assets \n(land, control of areas) in exchange for \"words\".

NO, what is being\ndemanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party\nfinally gets HOLD of this \"land\", what the \"other party\" does\nis totally irrelevent.

The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks\nwere commonplace.\n\n>Furthermore, with Hezbollah subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.\n\nThere is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \"disarmed\" UNLESS the state\nis as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take\nit upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially\nmirroring Israel's border secirity on its side.

When I look at\nJesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the\npresense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every\ndetail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But\nas that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His\npresense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it\nwas brought more and more to Jesus's attention (the betrayal of\nJudas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no\navail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not\nonly then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of\nJesus's suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical\nportion was only the tip of the iceburg.\n\nBTW, we know from John's account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly\nking.  From John:\n\nJOH 6:14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they\n            began to say, \"Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the\n            world.\"\nJOH 6:15    Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by\n            force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.\n\nThis does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an\nearthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew &\nGentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those\nwho would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus's\ndismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knew\nwhat His Father's will was and followed it obediently even in the\ndarkness of His Passion.\n\n-- \nJohn G.

Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\n\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government \nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\n\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist\nand revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle \nof those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians,\nthe international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and \nconsequently a number of governments and organizations have become \nsupportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

Don't forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\ncommand to make sure you're in binary.\n\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\nOTIStuff...\n\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\n\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n \nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\n              \nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\nare also welcome.\n\nOTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\ntougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \n\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \n\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \nemailing).\n\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\ncopies to:\n\nThe OTIS Project\nc/o Ed Stastny\nPO BX 241113\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\n\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\ndirectory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \n \nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\ncontact me and we'll arrange things.\n\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\nThis is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\nJPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather\nnot have to.\n\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\ncan stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \nget a slab-o-OTIS.\n\nAs of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISTRIBUTION?\n\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \n \nIt would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\n\nIt's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\nkeen of you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUSE?\n\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\nyou'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \nArtists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have \nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for \nyou, or give you their contact information.\n \nWhen you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\ncompensation for their files.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNAMING IMAGES?\n\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something\nlike:\n \n\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\n\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\nremain intact on all systems.  \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\n\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\ncase they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\naddress or other information you'd like people to know.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHMMM?!\n\nThat's about it for now.

Second, the historical\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\na la Chalcedon.\n\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\nthat Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\nprevailed.\n\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\n\nJason Albert\n\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call\nJesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\n\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\ngot the better of them.\n\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\n\nIt's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\nmust be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'\nparticipation in these things.

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in\naddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray\nlevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to\nformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial\nproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a\nparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4\nbit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the\n256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video\nsignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they\ndid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but\nthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they\nwould call Japan, etc.\n\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images\nfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not\nlike memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on\ngetting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would\ngreatly appreciate your sending it to me.\n\nThanks.\n\nAllan Weber\nSignal & Image Processing Institute\nUniversity of Southern California\nweber@sipi.usc.edu\n", "From: kludge@grissom.larc.nasa.gov (Scott Dorsey)\nSubject: Re: Need to find out number to a phone line\nOrganization: NASA Langley Research Center and Reptile Farm\nLines: 16\nNNTP-Posting-Host: grissom.larc.nasa.gov\n\nIn article <20756.2bd16dea@ecs.umass.edu> alee@ecs.umass.edu writes:\n>\n>Greetings!\n>      \n>        Situation:  I have a phone jack mounted on a wall.

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\n>  program.\n\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\n\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\n\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\n\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\n\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\nthe original problem.\n\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \n\n\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\n\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\n\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\n\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\n\n\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\n\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\n\tother words, will it halt?\n\n\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\n\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\n\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\n\tout to be undecidable.\n\n\nI won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\n\nA couple of references might be:\n\n1.

By the well known\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.

It's not a definite,\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\nevaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that \"had Morris\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"\n\n>It takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out\n>here in the real world guys.\n\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\n\nComputer...if you don't open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight\noff to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large ax.

(Read a book on gastroenterology\nsometime if you want to see a lot of them.)

And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine\ndoesn't have all the answers.\n\nThis person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe it's a\nmiracle cure, maybe it's valid.

U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge\nasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because\nof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.\n\nThe testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently\nended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither\nby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.\n\nThe day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,\nwho had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person\nnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as\nan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms\nin his dealings with Randy Weaver.\n\nFadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an\nAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two\nthen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in\ntime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons\ntransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \"He felt like he\n(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the\nWhite cause.\"\n\nThe two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and\nlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second\nmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to\ntape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-\ngauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of\n19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge\nshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of\n24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel\nlength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver\nis reported to have said that he could perform better work once\nhis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility\nof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars\nfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty\ndollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have\nsimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -\nover a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).\n\nThe next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that\nhis \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\nof the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, \"I had a guy in\nSpokane tell me you were bad.\"  Fadeley managed to convince\nWeaver otherwise.\n\nThe _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\nmade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these\nmeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki\nWeaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must\nhave also been phone taps.\n\nThese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\nloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's\nattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to\nmake sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has a\ncase at all...\" according to the rules.\n\nRandy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\nwife's voice on the tape.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear\naccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the\nWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect\nthis trial is not explained.\n\nOther notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning\nKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are\nsurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\nin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy\nWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\nHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report\nthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming\nat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics\nare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and\nDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that\nHarris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.\n\nTuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. \nKenneth Fadeley's testimony is scheduled to continue. \n\n", "From: pla@sktb.demon.co.uk (\"Paul L.

Incidentally, my MP has responded to\nmy questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved'\ncountries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries will\nget A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with\nA5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the\ncapabilities of the base station.\n\nThe cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to\nlisten in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but \ncellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users\nand fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular\ncalls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another\nbase-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled\ncall *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's\nequipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can\nlisten without having to obtain a warrant.\n\nBut, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant\nto get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see\nabove - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts,\nbut even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a\nwarrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge,\nit appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we'll stop\nlistening in'...\n\nYou have every reason to be scared shitless.

If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or\nshe will end up in all sorts of shit.   \n\nTony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe\nthe events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, \nwho thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the\nbook is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \"a is\nequal to b because a is equal to b\".\n\n  \n\n>\tI don't think most people understand what a Christian is.  \n\nThat would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed \nin religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all\nclaiming to be correct.  \n\nIt \n>is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.

A person from Jesus' culture authorized\nto conduct business \"in John's name\" had full authority over John's\nfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to\nwork only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was\nnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with\n\"in John's name\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney\nand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal\nand religious definitions of \"faith\".)\n\nWith this cultural background, praying \"in Jesus' name\" does not\nmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the\npetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous\n\"fiduciary\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His\nKingdom.  The message of \"praying in Jesus' name\" is thus closely\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\nresponsibilities.  This idea of praying \"in Jesus' name\" is not only\npresent but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal\nforumula is absent.\n\nThe act of praying the words \"In Jesus' Name\" may be beneficial if\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\nadvancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready\nto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.\n\nPrayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,\netc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by\nChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or\nC.E. for you P.C. :-).

I choose the\n>\tspace-optimizing compression scheme and started a full backup.\n>\tThe software estimated it would take about 22 minutes.  It\n>\ttook 4 1/2 hours.  Does this sound about right?\n\n\tThis is a bit long.  My system takes about 45 minutes to do \n\tthe same thing.  Usually 4.5 hours, particularly if the tape \n\tis grinding away the whole time means that your block size for \n\tthe write is too small.  Is there any way to change the block \n\tsize or write buffer size so it's bigger?\n\n>    o\tDuring the backup, about a dozen files came up with \"access\n>\tdenied\" errors.  Most of these were in C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM\n>\t(COMM.DRV, KEYBOARD.DRV, SHELL.DLL, etc.), but also\n>\tC:\\WINDOWS\\PROGMAN.EXE and a couple of files in the C:\\TAPE\n>\tdirectory.  Anyone else had this happen?\n\n\tThis is because the files are opened by DOS.  The files in the \n\tTAPE directory are likely the executable file or the configuration\n\tfile for the tape system.  I would recommend running the backup\n\tfrom DOS so it will make a complete backup of the TAPE directory.\n\n>Thanks for any and all feedback on this system.  I'd also appreciate\n>hearing of good sources for blank tape cartridges, preferably 250 Mb\n>size.\n\n\tThe 250mb cartridges won't do you any good since the drive\n\twon't write 250mb of physical data on the tape.  \n\n>Thanks.\n>-pd\n\n-- \n-brent williams (brentw@netcom.com) san jose, california\n", "From: louray@seas.gwu.edu (Michael Panayiotakis)\nSubject: Re: More Cool BMP files??\nOrganization: George Washington University\nLines: 15\n\n> \n>I downloaded the CompuServe GIF of the month.

Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \nPackard Scanners.  \n\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \n\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\n\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted \ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \n\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \nprocessor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a \nseperate TIFF or PCX file format.\n\nI was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nan Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.  \nWhile most of my faxes were received in \"standard\" mode (200x100 dpi), the \naccuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. \n\nOverall, a very impressive product.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \n(3). \n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \n\nReferences\n\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \nwas initiated. \n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \none patient 38 days after illness onset. \n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \n\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children's Hospital and \nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \nhealth action to prevent further cases. \n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \ncoli O157:H7. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Long-term use of \nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \nCDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \n(3). \n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\n49.6). \n\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \nenforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

When I read your response here, I see condescension.  When you\n>reply to a post, reply to the post you quote.  This statement undermines\n>any good points you might have had (it was enough to make me stop reading).\n\nSometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that\nway at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll\ntry to get better.\n\nRob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle\napproach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,\nonly responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both\ncases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse\nfor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.\n\nRob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. \nvasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is\nan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  \nI think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with\nhis set of excuses.  \n\nI just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants\nto know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses\nwhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the\nBible for himself and come to his own decisions without being\nsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.\n\nFrom my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man\nstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I \nsee a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away\nfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see\nthe dialog:\n\n\nMe:  \"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\" \n\nBK:  \"There is no truck.\"\n\nMe:  \"Turn around at look.\"\n\nBK:  \"No.\"\n\nMe:  \"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at\n     the oncoming truck.\"\n\nBK:  \"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\"\n\nMe:  \"Turn around or you will run over.\"\n\nBK:  \"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\"\n\nMe:  \"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing\n      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\"\n      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.\n\nBK:  \"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.\n      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\"\n      And by the way, I really have an open mind.\"\n\n\nSo is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   \n\nI do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not\nbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people\nfall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.\nI can now see the truck behind Brian.\n\nMy hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the\ntruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out\nof the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself\nto the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if\nhe so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that\nto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,\nBrian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he\ndoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his\nhead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is\nsatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \n\nThank you again Rob for your reproach.  I really do appreciate it.

Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\n('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\na threshold.\n  vonWrights's comment that Witt's \"sentences have a content that often lies\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\nWitt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\n\n  This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\nand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because\nif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  \n\n\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would\nsay unto me.\"  Job 23ff\n\n--Rex\n\nsuggested, easy reading about epistimology:  \"He is there and He is not Silent\"\n by Francis Schaeffer.\n", "From: wdstarr@athena.mit.edu (William December Starr)\nSubject: Re: Debating special \"hate crimes\" laws\nOrganization: Northeastern Law, Class of '93\nLines: 61\nNNTP-Posting-Host: nw12-326-1.mit.edu\nIn-reply-to: thf2@midway.uchicago.edu\n\n\nIn article <1993Apr4.235546.6450@midway.uchicago.edu>, \nthf2@midway.uchicago.edu said:\n\n> > This sort [of] separate treatment by the law has no place in an\n> > equal society; the solution to the fact that some classes are more\n> > vulnerable to attack or discrimination is to do what has always\n> > been done in response to imbalances in criminal activity and\n> > citizen protection: to allocate _law enforcement_ resources to\n> > more efficiently and effectively deal with the problems, not to\n> > rewrite the _law_ itself.

Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\n\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\nthe government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\nSpence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies\nbetween Cooper's statements last September and those made in court.\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\na few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.\"\n\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.\n\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\n\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\nhad Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, \"If\nyou're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong,\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\nkilling the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\ndefense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I'm not going to play games with either\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\nacting like professionals.\"\n\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we'll see\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \nSpence continued, \"We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\n\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can't have a fair trial if the\njury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm\nviolating court orders.\"\n\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\nhis comments when objecting.\n\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\nRampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\non the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.\n\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\nplans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"\n\nMonday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.  Scheduled\nis the continued cross-examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton.\n\n\n", "From: daz1@ns1.cc.lehigh.edu (DEMOSTHENIS A.

AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a\nbetter investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And\ndoes a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.\n\nNOTE: this isn't a flame on the GTZ, or other GM Quad 4 products.

It is an S3\n86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my\nsecond meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix\nfrom their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the\nordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from\nthem, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say \"Buy the memory\nfrom us\" or something like that.)\n\n\tThe one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a\n1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or\nenlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB\nof memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.\nJust ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I\nasked them why, and all I got was \"Your point is well taken, but\nOrchid's software developers are busy with other projects.\"\n\n\tSo, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805\ndrivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to\nget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next\ngeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my\nsystem and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're\nbroken.\n\n\tIf you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805\ncards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are \"less\nbusy\".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805\nproduct thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),\nalthough evenn that might be a misprint.\n\n\tPlease, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out\nthere, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I\ncoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.\n\nThanks.\ndonyee@athena.mit.edu\n", "Organization: University of Notre Dame - Office of Univ.

What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith\n(i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced\nof the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal\nrevelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those\nbeliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to\naccepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the\nconflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs\narise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God \nmust reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would \nhonestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone \nwho disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are \nrejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient \nfor them, or because they wish to spurn God.\n\nI would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one \nholds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is \nthat it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with\nGod.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas\nof doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or \nrevealed that truth.  \n\n-- \ncomments, criticism welcome...\n-Ken\nalvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\n\n[I agree with you.  --clh]\n", "From: lpzsml@unicorn.nott.ac.uk (Steve Lang)\nSubject: Re: Objective Values 'v' Scientific Accuracy (was Re: After 2000 years, can we say that Christian Morality is)\nOrganization: Nottingham University\nLines: 38\n\nIn article <C5J718.Jzv@dcs.ed.ac.uk>, tk@dcs.ed.ac.uk (Tommy Kelly) wrote:\n> In article <1qjahh$mrs@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de> frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer) writes:\n> \n> >Science (\"the real world\") has its basis in values, not the other way round, \n> >as you would wish it.  \n> \n> You must be using 'values' to mean something different from the way I\n> see it used normally.\n> \n> And you are certainly using 'Science' like that if you equate it to\n> \"the real world\".\n> \n> Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe\n> and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning\n> those perceptions.\n\nScience is the process of modeling the real world based on commonly agreed\ninterpretations of our observations (perceptions).\n\n> It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see.\n> Values are ... well they are what I value.\n> They are what I would have rather than not have - what I would experience\n> rather than not, and so on.\n\nValues can also refer to meaning.

In their names we demand justice.\n\nIn April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed \nde-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a \ngenocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively\nruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The \nresult: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen\nand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization\non those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any\nvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish\ngovernmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture\ndistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In \nthe face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies \nshamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy \nmerely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state \npolicy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a \ncrime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the \nsuccessful genocide of the Armenians.\n\nTurkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...\nArmenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of \nTurkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as \n\"rebels\".\n\nTurkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population\nfigures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.\n\nTurkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims \nArmenians were a \"threat\".\n\nIn a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of \napproximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.\n\nToday, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The\nsuccess of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish\npopulation.\n\nThe Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and\nproperty lost as a result of this genocide.\n\nARMENIANS DEMAND JUSTICE                              ERMENILER ADALET ISTIYOR\n\n\n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"Armenia has not learned a lesson in\nS.D.P.A.

An awful lot of the\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.\n\nPerhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\nabortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\n\nAnd besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\nethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory\nforced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.\n\n\nmathew\n", "From: mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider)\nSubject: Re: ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN RANCH!

I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this\ngrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the\ninvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from\nany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been\nbehind it.  What's going on here?\n\nLet's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\nI'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\nbecause I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\n\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\nobstensibly to perform \"gas insertions\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\nhim over the edge.\n\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\n\"gas insertion\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\n\nLet's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\n\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without\nall that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to\nshow the world how big her balls are.\n\nYesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.

The\nproposed groups are described below:\n\nNAME: \t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup\nSTATUS:  Unmoderated.\nPURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about\n\t system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.\n\nNAME:\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc\nSTATUS:\t Unmoderated.\nPURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,\n\t including issues such as security, networking features, console\n\t mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.\n\nRATIONALE:\n\tMicrosoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family\n\tof operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish\n\tto argue about the meaning of an \"OS\").  The family ranges from\n\tModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to\n\tWindows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over\n\t50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the\n\tactual release is slated for May/June '93.\n\n\tWhile Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares\n\tan application programming interface with the other members of the\n\tWindows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-\n\tdows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking\n\tand security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for\n\tWindows 3.1.\n\n\tThe user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows\n\t3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses\n\tProgram Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-\n\tsents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced\n\tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and\n\tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.\n\n\tThus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following\n\tgroups with the other members of the Windows family:\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.apps\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32\n\t\n\tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as\n\twell as Windows 3.1:\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.announce\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.advocacy\n\t\n\tIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the\n\tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal\n\tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating\n\tsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have\n\tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate\n\tnewsgroup hierarchies.\n\n\tFurther, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --\n\twhen the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-\n\tgeneration Windows, \"Chicago\", debuts next year, surely it should\n\tremain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-\n\ttification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?\n\n\nDISCUSSION PERIOD:\n\tThe discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  \n\nVOTING:\n\tThe CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on\n\tthe feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will\n\tbe accepted prior to the CFV.\n-- \n[ /tom haapanen -- tomh@metrics.com -- software metrics inc -- waterloo, ont ]\n[       \"stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth.  now pull ]\n[          up.  that's how the corrado makes you feel.\"  -- car, january '93 ]\n", "From: npet@bnr.ca (Nick Pettefar)\nSubject: Re: BMW battery\nNntp-Posting-Host: bmdhh299\nOrganization: BNR Europe Ltd, Maidenhead, UK\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\nLines: 31\n\nKeith Hanlan, on the Wed, 14 Apr 1993 19:20:14 GMT wibbled:\n: In article <1993Apr14.181352.6246@ra.msstate.edu> vech@Ra.MsState.Edu (Craig A.

Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished \nof butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only \nthe killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian \nArmenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of \nOttoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines \ngenocide as acting with a \n\n  'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a \n   national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' \n\nHistory shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate \nthe Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the \nArmenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including \nU.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy \nas a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of \nthe x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the \nextermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor \nthose who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. \n\nThe eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,\nbeyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people\nduring the war were planned and premeditated.

The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n* What are the US export regulations?\n* What is TEMPEST?\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\n* Is RSA patented?\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\n\n\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n\n  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It\n  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and\n  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is\n  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,\n  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the\n  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of\n  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many\n  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break\n  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national\n  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.\n\n  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of\n  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the\n  difference between public and private research in cryptography:\n\n  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,\n  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted\n  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged\n  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of\n  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10\n  years has there in fact been widespread open research in\n  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\n  between these two research communities. Open research is common\n  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open\n  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in\n  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with\n  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,\n  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can\n  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might\n  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?\n  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would\n  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one\n  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with\n  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most\n  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have\n  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in\n  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which\n  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''\n\n* What are the US export regulations?\n\n  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control\n  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export\n  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by\n  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office\n  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized\n  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule\n  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent\n  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see\n  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.\n\n  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting\n  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what\n  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which\n  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to\n  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\n  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at\n  least heard of the ITAR.\n\n* What is TEMPEST?\n\n  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer\n  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that\n  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at\n  quite a distance and with little effort.\n\n  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext\n  is available this way.\n\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\n\n  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for\n  corrections.)\n\n  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas\n  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass\n  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving\n  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the\n  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.\n  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;\n  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the\n  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;\n  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.\n\n  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various\n  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:\n\n  The Beale Cypher Association\n  P.O. Box 975\n  Beaver Falls, PA 15010\n\n  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the\n  line:\n\n  send index\n\n  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.\n  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher\n  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,\n  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)\n\n  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of\n  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI\n  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.\n  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this\n  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an\n  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this\n  string.\n\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\n\n  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis\n  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with\n  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes\n  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in\n  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,\n  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.\n\n  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;\n  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent\n  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.\n\n* Is RSA patented?\n\n  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.\n  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been\n  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral\n  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information\n  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of\n  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as\n  ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other\n  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.\n\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\n\n  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the\n  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list\n  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>\n\n  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\n\n  There's all sorts of information about the manuscript itself, of\n  course.

The estimated population\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\n of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \n (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n Tartar villages.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\nwill take particular claims at face value.\n\nImmanuel:\n\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\n\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\n       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\n       spoken by a prophet:\n\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\n       lord G'd said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\n       Ahaz said, \"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G'd is with us.\"   He will\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\n       you dread will have been deserted...\n\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\nlater Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\n\nEgypt:\n\n       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\n\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\n\n\nWhat the lord really said was this.\n\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning\n       incense to idols.\n\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\n\nRachel Weeps:\n\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\n\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\n\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\n       no more.\"   \n\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance\nthe message of the church's gospel.\n       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\nwould not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\nconvincing.\n\nThe Nazarene:\n\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \n\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\n\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that\nshe will,\n\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\n\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. \nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\nsimple making them up now.\n\nBearing our\nDiseases:\n\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\nand disabilities.\n\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\n       diseases.\"\n\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\n\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\n\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\nof Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\ninstrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\n\n\nSilent Messiah:\n\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse\nthe attention of the local rulers.\n\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \n\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\n       name.\"\n\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\n\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\n       await his law.\n\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\nG'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\nbe the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\n\nThree Days and\nThree Nights:\n\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\nresurrection.\n\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\n       three nights.\n\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\n\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\ngod's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\n\nHearing &\nUnderstanding:\n\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\n\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \n\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\n       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\n       them.\"\n\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\n\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, \"Go, and say to this\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\n       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\n       stump.\n\nHere we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel\nto stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the\npromise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\nof G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\nof Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't\nunderstand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the\npresent.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face. \n\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they\nhave the prophetic approval.\n\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\n       foundation of the world.\"\n\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\n       lord...\n\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\nof Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. \nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\nof it up.\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\nMatthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\n\n\nExcuses of\nLittle Faith:\n\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\nthey didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\nwoman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\n\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \n\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see\nGod anymore.\n\n       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're\n       sinful; it's just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\n       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...\n\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear\nreader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be\ntrue. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say\nour little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\nlives of people change... that is seeing G'd.\"   Thus people get\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is\nnot seeing G'd the way people used to see.  \n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\nhas little faith.\n\f\nJesus Rides on\nan Ass:\n\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\nJerusalem.  \n\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\n       by the prophet, saying,\n\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\n       ass-colt.\"\n\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\ndifferently.\n\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\n\nThere isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\n\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\n\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'\n\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\nfit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\nMatthew, \"Haven't you read?\" for the source reads,\n\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\n       enemy and the avenger.\n\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\njust one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic\nscripture.\n\nYHVH said to \nmy lord...:\n\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\n\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\n\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\nnature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \nBut, there are problems.\n       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\nhis audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\n\n       YHVH's utterance to my lord:\n\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\n       footstool.\"\n\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\n       holy mountains.  \n\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\n       forever.\"\n\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an\naddress of respect.  \n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\npoet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\nfrom David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive\ntales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any\npraises of a messiah.\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of\nfavour for David's kingdom on hold.  \n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\npromised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\n\nMoses & Jesus,\nHad it Together\nAll Along...:\n\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\npseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\nfrom the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. \nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\nby G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\n\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\n\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\nwhich corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\nstill cling to it.\n\nThe Potter's\nField:\n\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\n\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn't lawful for\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter's field with it to\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\n\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\n\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\nMatthew makes use of.\n\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\n       YHVH.\n\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\nof the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\nshortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\nMatthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas \"potter's\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\nMatthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\nintentional dishonesty.\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing\nenough.\n\nWine, Vinegar,\n& Casting Lots:\n\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\n\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\n\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\n\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\n\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\n\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\n       Book of the Living.\n\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\npsalm asks G'd for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\nJesus of the gospels says,\n\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\n       don't know what they do!\"\n\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\n\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\nsay that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\nJesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\nsuspicions.\n\nThe 22nd Psalm:\n\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\nwill examine the primary passages.\n\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\n       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.\n\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\nboth day and night on the cross.\n\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\n\nThis seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\n\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\n\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\n\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\n\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\n\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\n       hands and feet...\n\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka'ari),\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka'aru.\"   But, to\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\ntranslators.\n\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\npsalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\nthe forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.\n\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\ninterpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\nthings for St. Matthew.\n\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's\ncrucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,\n\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\n       \"The will look on him whom they've pierced.\"\n\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\nthem.\n\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\n\nJohn's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\nMatthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\nthan just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\nreligion were founded.\n\n\f\nReckoned with\nTransgressors:\n\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\n\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\n\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\n\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\n\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\n\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\n       with him railed, \"Aren't you the messiah?! Save\n       yourself, and us!\"\n\nThis certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\n\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\n       \"Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\n\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\napparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\nLuke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  \nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\nwords of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\nseen.\n\nThe End of the\nWorld--\n       Mt. 24:\n\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\nwhich he has been warning about.\n\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\n\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\n       the mountains.\n\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\n       pass away until all these things take place...\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\n       at an hour you do not expect.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\nthem that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\nswept away.\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\nhe didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\nat the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\n\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\njust the right moment to spring?\n\n\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\nChristianity can securely keep hold.\n\n       [Mt 10.34]  Jesus: \"Don't think that I have come to\n       bring peace on earth.  I haven't come to bring peace,\n       but rather a sword.\"\n\n\n\n", "From: hambidge@bms.com\nSubject: Re: ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN RANCH!

A genocide of Armenians took place\nduring peacetime.\n\nAnd it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in\nthose days. He was still young. Born in 1926.\n\nOn that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there \nwas unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we \ndidn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they\nwouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd \nnear the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home \nwatching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir \nStreet. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our \nhouse is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields\nthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the \ndirection of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and \nstarted shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off \nthe light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the\nlight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know \nand thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.\n\nSuddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:\nthere were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother\nAleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War \nII and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.\n\nWe went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down \nwith axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \"What's going on? What's \nhappened?\" They say, \"Armenians, get out of here!\" We don't open the door, we \nsay, \"If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow.\" They say, \"No, \nleave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!\" By now they've \nbroken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best\nwe can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. \nWe had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,\nand grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and\nwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no\npolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We \nheld the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an \naxe, and then with a crowbar.\n\nWhen the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them \nwith the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, \npipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father \nin the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the\nroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother\nSasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he\nwas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured \nseveral of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But \nthey, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there\nwere many of them.\n\nThe door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go \ninto the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought \nskewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father \nbleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \nand his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw \nthat. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove\nthem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the \nbandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in \nthere, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to \nchase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of \nabout 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and\nMother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and \nstarted calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through\nthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no \none came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader \nof the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a \nfur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \"What's with you, \nwoman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\"\nShe says, \"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\" My father \nwas a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian \nand Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, \n\"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he \nbrought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" He says, \"You \ndon't need to shout, stop shouting.\" And when they heard the voice of this \nman, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \nstarted running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, \ntoo. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't \nknow if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even\nthough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started \nto massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to \ncall an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \nevening and all through the night.\n\nSomewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were \nfrom Khachmas. They said, \"We heard that a group was here at your place, you \nhave our condolences.\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay\nin the room.\n\nSo we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,\nwe say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around \none o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, \ninvestigators. They say, \"Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back \nhere soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\"\nThen people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take \nFather away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take \nFather away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,\nbut no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the \nneighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should \nhide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and \nwent up to the neighbor's.\n\nThe excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,\nZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a \nlanding force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A\ncrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings\n19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking \ninto Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians \nweren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they \npoured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were \nsome Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"They're up there, still,\nup there. Let's go kill them!\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in \nthe two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding \none floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door \nshouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling \nthe corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, \nand the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \"No, that's from some of the \nfurniture.\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed \nhim down.\n\nThe mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and \nwent into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also\nArmenians, they had left for another city.\n\nThe father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"Are you \ncrazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the \napartments? They could kill you and them!\" And to us :\" . . . Come on, leave \nthis apartment!\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. At\nfirst the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and\nhe relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound\nof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went \ndownstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the \nother rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. \nThey left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal \nthey had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our\nMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\n\nWith the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were \nsaved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely \naccidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the \ncrowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only\nable to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on \nthe bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We \nwere also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our\nshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the \ntroops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been \neven greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the \ngenocide.\n\nThrough an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the \nleadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their \norders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to '\npick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock \nin the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was \nquite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried \nFather into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were \nabout six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It \nwas gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people \nthere, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being\ntaken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well, \nthere was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It \nwas something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The \nchild that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible\nto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a \nman there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces \nwere disfigured, they were in such awful condition...\n\nNow two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what \nhappened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my \nfather, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.\n\nI still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was\nestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what \nhappened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.\n\nI'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They\neven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel \nmixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They \nweren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our \ntroops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right\nacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The \ninhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the \nsoldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They \nweren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were \nat the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket \noffice I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing \nArmenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that \nthey were being burned. During those days no one from the police department \ncame to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though\nperhaps they could have come and saved us.\n\nAs we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus \nstation. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in \nfighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in \nwhich buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had\nlists, the bandits. You can tell that the \"operation\" was  planned in advance.\n\nThanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the\nleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian\npeople, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops \nsuffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my \nfamily and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait\nArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would\nhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.\n\nAt present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR\nProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest\npossible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could \nhappen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted\nout for such deeds.\n\nVery many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass \ndisturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,\nvery few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There \nwere around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took \npart in the pogrom of our building all in all.\n\nThey should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that \nretribution awaits those who perform such acts.\n\n   May 18, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

The change to Snow also\nproved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSU\ngoalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by\nboth.  Snow won.

Over their careers, Clemens has \"won\" 68% of\nthe games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17\nwins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing\nthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If\nso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris\nallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in\nhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA.

You see, unless you believe in some mystical link\nbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man\nwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky.

In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established \na vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two \ncontinents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and \nWaffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in \nespionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and \nArabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under \nGerman 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National \nCouncil.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional \nRecord,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, \nNazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often \nexpressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war.

We installed Paradox for Windows, (but I don't think \nParadox is the real problem here), and the installation went ok\n(windows is installed on a local drive, paradox installed on a novell\nnetwork (netware 386 v3.26 or greater), DOS 5, Win 3.1) but the program\nwill not load in 386 enchanted mode.  The thermometer bar goes to 60%\nand we then either get a 'invalid command.com' or a windows nastygram\ntalking about an illegal instruction.  I've checked out the command.com\nthing, but as a long-time C programmer, I've crashed my share of machines\nwith pointer problems and this is a standard behavior :-)\n\nAnyway, paradox will run in standard mode, but not enhanced.  We also have\nquattro pro windows, exhibiting the same behavior.  Spent about 2 hours\nwith Borland's tech people, with no avail.  The guy I talked to a microsoft\ndidn't want to really dig in and help, as he gave up pretty quickly.\nSomewhat disappointing, really.  I expected more from Microsoft.  You'd think\nwith all the millions of windows installations that they would have seen all\nthe possible problems, but I guess not...\n\nMicrosoft had sent us a 13 page fax on fixing UAE and General\nProtection faults (sorry, I can't fax anything out of here so please\ndon't ask, try Microsoft), which we tried.  We did *everything* they\nsaid, and still no luck.\n\nSo.  If you can help, please mail me.

If not, please do so before posting this misinterpretation again.\n>It refers to the right of the people to organize a militia, not for individuals \n>to carry handguns, grenades, and assault rifles.  \n\nThe Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that\n\"the people\" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and\nhave explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.\n\nI quote:\n\n  \"... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in\n  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the\n  Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the\n  the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people\n  to keep and bear Arms ....\"\n\t- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).\n\nFurthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution\nfor possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not\npresented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the\ngovernment that such weapons have no military value -- they held that\nthe amendment protected the individual right to possess military\nweapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully\ngotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the\ninterpretation.\n\nFurthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:\n\n \"The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,\n  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the\n  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major\n  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-\n  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right\n  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.\"\n   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the\n     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,\n     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )\n\nYou might rightfully ask \"well then, what does that first bit about\nmilitias mean?\"\n\nWell, \"militia\" in historical context basically means the whole of the\nadult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines\n\"militia\" as all armed men over the age of 17).\n\n   \"The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting\n    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were\n    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of\n    the kind in common use at the time.\"\n\t- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).\n\nThe reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale\nbehind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to\nbear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military\npower could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the\ngovernment would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than\nthe other way around.\n\n   \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason\n   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last\n   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\"\n     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776\n       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).\n\n   \"And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not\n   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of\n   resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be\n   refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\"\n     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in\n       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).\n\n   \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;\n   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme\n   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;\n   because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute\n   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on\n   any pretense, raised in the United States.\"\n     - Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles\n       of the Federal Constitution\" (1787), in Pamphlets on the\n       Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n\nYou may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it be\nrepealed, but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that it\ndoesn't mean what it says. You might argue that conditions have\nchanged and that it should no longer be present, but you can't imagine\nit away.\n\nI could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already.\n\nHowever, none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  Lets get\nit out of here.

Hopefully with the coaches stress on\nsituational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower\nthis year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and\nLankford and Zeile's off year).\n\nI don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the \nFilly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  \nGive the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games \nand we'll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching \nstaff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the\ndifference.\n\nOn a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some \nbaseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked \nwhere to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied \"Fair.\"  I \nremember it being in the \"They Said It\" section of Sports Illustrated.\nI would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.\n\nGO REDBIRDS!!\n\nGary Wieman\n", "From: baileyc@ucsu.Colorado.EDU (Christopher R.

The fact is, there are *two* references to\nJesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least\nbeen altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that\nJosephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage\nsays the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the\nJews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho\nfor Jesus and may be authentic.\n   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference\nto Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which\nlack the references.\n\nIt is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but\nI don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in\nthe scholarly community that this is the case.

And he is a professor of German, not of\nbiblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to\nthe historicity of Jesus.)\n\nJim Lippard              Lippard@CCIT.ARIZONA.EDU\nDept. of Philosophy      Lippard@ARIZVMS.BITNET\nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, AZ 85721\n", "From: daveb@pogo.wv.tek.com (Dave Butler)\nSubject: Re: NEW BIBLICAL CONTRADICTIONS [still not] ANSWERED (Judas)\nOrganization: Tektronix, Inc., Wilsonville,  OR.\nLines: 180\n\nMr DeCenso, in spite of requiring Scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas,\nrejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases\nthose scholars opinion on the subject:\n\n> ...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records\n> his death.

Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\n\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\n\t\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\n\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\n\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\n\nA couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\nreferences though, \"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New\nTestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\nfurther context).  \n\nThe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging.\" He then\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\nhanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\ndenoted as the result). \n\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\n\n> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\n> it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice \n> was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house,\n> to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and \n> died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.\"   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n> ^^^^ \n> Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept.,\n> APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\n> result.\n> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\n\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\nHebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \n\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\nhistorical source to justify it. \n\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:\n\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\n\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \n\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\nas the 30 silvers:\n\n> As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\n> money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\n> than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\n> mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\n> what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\n> Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\n> that when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\n> discusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\n> it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\n> \n>  \n> Notice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\n> that Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\n> But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\n> obtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\n>          ^^^^^^\n\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas'\nactions \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\nthe money box, but rather said:\n\n    \"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\n     him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\n     it was night.\"\n\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \n\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\nthat night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \n\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\n\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\n\n> Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\n> this with you.\n\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse we\nare discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping \nthese issues.\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n\tA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\n\t\t\t\tDavid Hume, Philosopher\n\t\t\t\tAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding\n\n    PS.

Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time\nto go get a toolmeans you're not doing it right away, and that lessens the\nimpact.  It's very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the\nfact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -\nis called a spanking.\n>\n>5. If you do not spank, what method of discipline do you use?\n     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared\na good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made\nsure they didn't play together for 5 days so he'd know that would make him\nlose friends very quickly.  He's never done anything like that since.\n     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don't keep\narguing with me over leaving, since it's hard to argue with a macine.\nI will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won't be over until they\ncalm down if they're too tantrumy.

I hope you can use this to\nteach all parents that physical punishment isn't always required - parents use\nthat as an excuse to hit too hard.\n\n>9.  How ere you disciplined as a kid\n     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband's have never\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God's law.\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \"what\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\"  The Bible also says in all\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)\nThere is no room for selfish anger, which I'll admit I've been tempted with\nat times.  When I've felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\ndevil's work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God's\nforgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that\nwhat I had done was enough punishment.\n-- \nDoug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: \"Mommys and Daddys & other\n    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love\nmissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, 'cause Heaven is just a great\nhe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!\"\n", "From: dabl2@nlm.nih.gov (Don A.B.

Notwithstanding the military\n    establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are\n    carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments\n    are afraid to trust the people with arms.\"\n                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n    James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: \"The right\n    of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A\n    well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,\n                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free\n    country...\"\n\n    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of\n    the militia): \"Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with\n    respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\n    will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\n    a year.\"\n\n    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing\n    armies): \"... if circumstances should at any time oblige the\n    government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be\n    formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large\n    body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their\n                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****\n    own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.\"\n    ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBut *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when they\nsaid \"people\", right?

That's why the Right is reserved to the People.

He\nonly wrote it.\n\n> The amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with \n> the security of a free state.

Gay people are and will\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans that\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\nFortunately African-Americans had \"whites\" who supported their 'cause' and\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\n\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love,\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\nin the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\ntreated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such.  I guess I've\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\n\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\n\nI'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\noppressive legisation against gays.\n\nPerhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\n\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\n\"conditional\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \"unconditional\"\nlove, one that calls people \"just as they are.\"  Sure there are things that\nwill 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other\npeople's expectations.\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\n\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\nsomething very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\non thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\nGay people are not criminals.\n\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self-\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\nrecently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\n\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\nColorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over\nColorado called \"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\nis \"Working for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\n\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\nembracing.\n\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\ntowards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\nexcluding people.\n\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\"\npeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful,\nespecially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto\nitself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people\nto Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?\n\nWhatever\n\nRich :-(\n", "From: phs431d@vaxc.cc.monash.edu.au\nSubject: Re: The arrogance of Christians\nOrganization: Monash University - Melbourne.

Geez Allen any\norganization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate\ncosts, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support\na program and \"wrap\" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap\nwas on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you\nsay is not true. Which is it Allen?\n\n>>>Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate.

You admit here that this is wrong.\nNasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some\nnumbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then\nhowl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.\n\n>>No Allen you did not.

Apollo integration was \ndone here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of\nReston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are\ncompletely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There\nis no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project\nthat it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for \nApollo?\n\n>Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs.

I agree that JSC screwed up big.\nThey should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it\nreplaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your\nbias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just\nhow wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what\nthey want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it. \n\n>>Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is\n>>at a place where everything is overhead.\n> \n>When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that\n>integration isn't overhead. It is the single most important part\n>of a successful large scale effort.\n>\n\nI agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful\nlarge scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that\nintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called\nleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for\nthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership\nand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up\nas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC\nand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to\nfinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the\nprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.\n\nThere is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that\nfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the\nturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is\nlack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of\nleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a\nsymptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your\nefforts that you do not see this.\n\n>>Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally\n>>demanded change that caused the problems? Methinks that you are being \n>>selective with the facts again.\n> \n>The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on\n>Congress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers\n>you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address\n>the problems until the press published the story.\n> \n>Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address\n>the overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?\n>\n\nNo, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have \nhappened in the first place.\n\n>>If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost\n>>of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. You stated that your\n>>\"friend\" at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it\n>>for a billion a year \"if the wrap were gone\".

The following letter, which represents a small portion \nof the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical \ndocuments, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, \nwas sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, \nprogram directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and \nradio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide \nof 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people \nof Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the \nlost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is \nmourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their \nlives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations \nmay live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and \nprosperously.\n\n------------------------- letter ----------------------------------\n\nDuring the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \nhas planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which \nnot only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the \nmethod used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, \nTurkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order \nto cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, \nwhich is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia \ncontinues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:\n\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\nresponsibility.\n\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \nTriangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish \nGenocide.\n\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\n\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\n\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\n\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its \nterrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks \nto the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically \nexterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on \nthis issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of \ngovernments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition \nof the Turkish Genocide.\n\nWith the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial\ndemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people\nwill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims\nof the Turkish Genocide demand:\n\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \nDictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\n\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\nKurdish people;\n\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for \ntheir heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\n\n4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially\nrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse\nto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;\n\n5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it \nhas adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially \nrecognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be \nsupportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;\n\n6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact \nof the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of \n2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.\n\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new \ngeneration has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically\nmature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through\nall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the \narmed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon\nall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in \nthe political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary\nof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.\n\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

The dogs\nhad episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5\nmonths after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further\nclinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.

Strictly,\na 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change\nstate, according to the inputs.\n\nA demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which\nof four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are\nthree inputs required.\n\nA decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable\ninput, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all\noutputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output\nwill be low).\n\nAn eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to\nselect which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your\naim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note\nthat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since\nyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left\nonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.\n\nA sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus\na mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use\nthe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the\nfour enable lines.\n\nOf course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the\nfour final stage decoders.\n\nPlease give me the credit when you submit your homework.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n", "From: smithw@col.hp.com (Walter Smith)\nSubject: Re: Part 1 and part 2  (re: Homosexuality)\nOrganization: Colorado Springs IT Center\nLines: 23\nNNTP-Posting-Host: fajita19.cs.itc.hp.com\n\nhudson@athena.cs.uga.edu (Paul Hudson Jr) writes:\n> In article <m0njXCg-0000VEC@juts.ccc.amdahl.com> rich.bellacera@amail.amdahl.com writes:\n> \n> >Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people\n> >to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?\n> \n> Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus.\n> But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in. \n\nVery well put.

The first attempt failed in the summer\n\tof 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules\n\tstate that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started\n\tafter a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).\n\tThis is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and\n\tcomp.os.os2.bugs.\n\n\tThis document contains:\n\t*  the background showing the need for these proposals\n\t*  the proposed charters for these proposals\n\t*  voting instructions\n\t*  a voting ballot\n\t*  some example ballots\n\t*  the voting rules\n\t*  the voting schedule\n\t*  the Mass Acknowledgement\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\tThe creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2\n\tand emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred\n\ta continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such\n\tas emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and\n\tmuch more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,\n\tallowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.\n\n\tMuch of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and\n\tlater, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the\n\tnumber of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility\n\twith their hardware increases, as does the questions on the\n\tavailability of drivers for their hardware, installation\n\tprocedures, etc.\n\n\tMultimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows\n\tMultimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is\n\tincluding direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version\n\t2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).\n\n\tAny non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,\n\tespecially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.\n\tSo far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks\n\t(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or\n\tfor free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read\n\tcomp.os.os2.misc for details).\n\n\nProposed Charters:\n\n\t(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for developers of ported software so\n\t\tas to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and\n\t\tspur additional development.  The group will also cover\n\t\ttopics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,\n\t\tWindows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program\n\t\tportability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and\n\t\tso forth.\n\n\t(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tTo keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy\n\t\torthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.\n\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup\n\t\tfor OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and\n\t\ttechnical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.\n\n\t(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the\n\t\tavailability of device drivers, compatibility information,\n\t\tinstallation procedures, system requirements, and overall\n\t\tperformance optimization.\n\n\t(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.\n\n\t(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug\n\t\tdiagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system\n\t\tpatches and corrective service disks, and so forth.\n\n\t\t[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other\n\t\tnewsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.beta]\n\n\nHow to Vote:\n\n\tTo cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.\n\tMany newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this\n\tpost.

If you vote more than once, only the most\n\t  recent vote will be counted.\n\n\t* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,\n\t  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.\n\n\t* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings\n\t  will be revealed only after the poll closes.\n\n\t* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will\n\t  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).\n\n\t* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how\n\t  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.\n\t  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is\n\t  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.\n\n\t* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this\n\t  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.\n\n\t* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal\n\t  passes if both of the following formulas are true:\n\t  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes\n\t      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).\n\t  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the\n\t      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).\n\t  In other words, a proposal passes if:\n\t      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)\n\t  where max() returns the highest number given to it.\n\n\nSchedule:\n\n\tThe voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted\n\tby David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).\n\n\tThis third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the\n\tMass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who\n\thave already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you\n\thave not voted yet, vote now!\n\n\tThe voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on\n\tApril 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.\n\tThe voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that\n\tdate.\n\n\nMass Acknowledgement:\n\n\tHere is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots\n\tas of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:\n\n                          bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu\nAiyagari, Sanjay          ska1@crux3.cit.cornell.edu\nAlcorn, Justin

Rana  (rana@rintintin.colorado.edu)  \nCo-Moderator:  Dr. Tahir Ijaz  (ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca)\n\n\n\nA BRIEF DESCRIPTION ABOUT AHMADIYYA/ISLAM:\n=========================================\n\n\n        The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, an international organi-\nsation, was founder in 1989 in Qadian, India. The founder of this\nsect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the\nPromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major\nreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-\nduism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of\nJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised\nMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all\nthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger\nfrom God have been fulfilled.\n\n        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and\nextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-\ntians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-\nnessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect\nis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.\nDispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many\nadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who\ncome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.\n\n        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about\na better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-\ngions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-\nerhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi\nMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-\ncially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-\nics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed\nby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's\ninternal resources.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal religion.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================\n\n        When the Call For Votes is called,  the  discussion  will\nofficially  end.   Voting  will be held for about three weeks. If\nthe group gets 2/3rd majority AND  100  more  \"YES/Create\"  votes\nthan  \"NO/don't  create\"  votes;  the group shall be created.

What is the source of this pseudo-doctrine? Who is\n> the pseudo-teacher? Who is the Great Deceiver?\n\nOK, here's at least one Christian's answer:\n\nJesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes\nsense.  Matt 5:17 \"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or\nthe Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\"  Jesus lived\nunder the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises\nof the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey\nGod's purposes.\n\nVerse 18 says \"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass\naway, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,\nuntil all is accomplished.\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last \nphrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \"accomplished\" what the \nLaw was supposed to accomplish.  \n\nVerse 19:  \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\nand so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;\nbut whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the\nkingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \npeople about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\n\nIn general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \nmust have received about \"doing away with the Law.\"  That was not \nJesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it \nshould be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his \npeople all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your \nheel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \"doing \naway with the Law\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as \nequal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious \nleaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only \nGod's Law.\n\nIn the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law \nand defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon \non the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people \nunderstand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which \nhad been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.\n\nIn Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the \nLaw in this way:\n\n[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being \nshut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore \nthe Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be \njustified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no \nlonger under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith \nin Christ Jesus.\n\nI believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had \nserved it's purpose, i.e. \"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\" and\nnow, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\"  The law has been \"fulfilled\" \nas Christ said he would do.\n\nGod, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same\npersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \"last\nwill and testament\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. \nIt makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are\nre-expressed in Christianity. \n\nOn the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and \nChristians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes \nsense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to \nrepresent the \"mysteries\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism \nrepresenting Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),\nThe Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and\nSunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,\nActs 20:7)\n\nOK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all\nthese issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome\nother Christians to offer other alternatives.\n\nPlease excuse the long posting.

If they get caught, there is no punishment\n at all.

Of course this doesn't happen\n any more.  That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching\n him some respect for others.  A person with that little respect would\n inevitably wind up dead early anyway.\n\n   The problem is creeping gradualism.  If you put a frog into hot water,\n he just jumps out.  But if you put him into cold water and then ever-so-\n gradually heat it, the frog will cook.

For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much\nconfusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been\nto their benefit and comfort.\"\n\nBradford did not blame this failure on the \"strangers\", but on the basic\nselfishness in all men.  He wrote \"seeing all men have this corruption in\nthem, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them.\"  In other\nwords, according to Westbrook, \"Bradford found private enterprise to be\nthe most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state.\"\n\nLet's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.

One\nguy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,\nI saw one think that someone said about \"Show me a team that used Split-\nfires....\"  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories\nabout splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.\n\nSplitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and\nincreased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing\non horsepower numbers.\n\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\nbut 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\nSo for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\n\nBut what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,\nbut many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for\nthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,\ntwins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this\ntranslate?  Increased torque should \"theoretically\" help twins make\nmore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods\nor anything made, just stick 'em in.\n\nNow I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with\nsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than\n4's.        \n\nAs far as racing teams....  Ducati team \"Fast by Ferraci\" used\nsplitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James\nrunning for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.\nAlso, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....\n\nPeace.\n\nWarren\nwcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\"Have Suzuki, will travel...\"\n\nAt a local \"fix-er-up-er\" shop, the bike repairest looked at a\ndumped ZX-7.

Apparently, the\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\nNational Security Agency.  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\nsplit key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\nmanufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would\nstore users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\npresentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be\nclassified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\nincorporation into its communications products.\n\n     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\n\nFirst, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\ninquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\nproduct. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\nFurthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\nthe Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\nshould be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\n\nSecond, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the\nAdministration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF\nbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The\npublic will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\nopen to independent, expert scrutiny.  \n\nThird, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\nprove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\nneeds, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\nadopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \nDoes disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth\nAmendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\nof the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\nanswer.\n\nIn sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\nof these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\nand security.  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be\nconsidered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\ndiscussion even begins.\n\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\nESCROW\n\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom\nhold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device\nwould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow\nagents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\n\nUpon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\nhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to\nthe Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\nasked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration\nhave suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\nFederal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\nbut there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\n\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\n\nThe Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which\nthe government or others could break the code without securing keys from\nthe escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no\nback doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,\nAdministration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto\ncracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the\nalgorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be\nmade public.\n\nThe Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,\nsecret contract between the National Security Agency and two private\nfirms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for\nabout four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.\n\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\n\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes\nin the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers\nfor this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al\nGore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press\nbriefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any\nprivate organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had\nno independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY\n\nThe Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an\ninquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,\nand law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export\ncontrols on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony\nProposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the\nNational Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential\nDirective describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement\nin the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.\n\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\n\nJerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org)\nDaniel J.

For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 is\nreserved for LPT2.

The way to do that may be detaching crypto chip from \ncommunication equipment. It seems logical to provide Clipper chip \nto the end-user not as a part of phone, fax, modem & like but in the\nform of smart-card compatible with various telecomm. products. Banks \nwill encourage extensive use of new cards to make transactions by phone.\nNatural step will be to cross-reference this card to the person in the \ngovernment databases - or else this new version of \"wiretap proposal\" \nmake no sence at all; one wish to eavesdrop (spell.) on the particular \nperson, not on the particular modem or phone.\n \nAs a side note, I disagree with one poster, who said he won't care about\nability of the government to eavesdrop, since they can do that now \nanyway. Clipper will take away electronic survelliance from citizens, \nmaking it monopoly of the government. May be, we can find examples when\ninterceptions made by (unauthorised) people uncovered crimes of \nstate officials ?\n\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      For PGP2.1 public key finger mkagalen@lynx.dac.northeastern.edu\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n", "From: mwchiu@tigr.org (Man-Wai Chiu)\nSubject: Xm1.2.1 and OW server\nOrganization: UTexas Mail-to-News Gateway\nLines: 43\nDistribution: inet\nNNTP-Posting-Host: cs.utexas.edu\n\n\nWe have a program written with X11R5 and Motif 1.2.1.

(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll \ngive you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The first is that this is the meeting of the \nPresidents, so the money that's being promised is government \nmoney, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the \ngovernment.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going \nto be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian \nbusinesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What \nare the priorities, because there are several association of \nRussian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to \nparticipate in setting up priorities for investment?  \n\t     \n\t     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know \nthat polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans \nare very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls \nsay that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times \npublished that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; \n42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent \nif it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to \nsort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not \nvery enthusiastic?  Thank you.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going \nto be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the \nanswers.  Just the answers.  Okay.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, \nit depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, \nthe funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will \nobviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be \ngood risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will \nbe used to support the privatization of existing public \nenterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the \nDemocracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have \nsome influence over the distribution of.  \n\t     \n\t     With regard to your second question, let me say that \nI would think that there would be people in both countries who \nwould not feel too warmly toward simply the American government \ngiving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to \nthat in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history \nthere has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That \nis, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole \nhistory of America, any kind of aid program has always been \nunpopular.  \n\t     \n\t     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is \nthis is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that \nthis is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --\ntrillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments \nbecause of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in \nRussia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them \nworking on a democracy and struggling to get their economies \ngoing, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it \npossible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the \neconomy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and \ninvestment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce \nnuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on \nour side and on the Russian side.  \n\t     \n\t     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an \ninvestment for the United States.  This is very much in the \ninterest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the \nsecond stage of the program, which I hope to put together next \nweek, in my view are things that are good for my country and for \nthe taxpayers and workers of my country.  \n\t     \n\t     Russia is a very great nation that needs some \npartnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share \nher goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view \nthis as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not \nwhat it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful \ninvestment.  \n\t     \n\t     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But \nthere's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than \nthe $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier \nof the Cold War.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, first of all thank you very \nmuch, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory \nof the living correspondents, this is the first time an American \nPresident is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind \nof a very measured breakthrough.  \n\t     \n\t     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory \nremarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief \nthat you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you \ntell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to \nwhat might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification \nof START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how \nconfident you are that the United States Congress would be eager \nto support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions \ninherited from the Cold War?  \n\t     \n\t     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of \nUkraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with \nregard to the need to proceed to have the other independent \nstates all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States \ndevelop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing \nthat we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of \nthe Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude \nour own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that \nwould provide not only an important economic opportunity for \nRussia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out \non our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed \noff on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and \nwe agreed to continue to press that.\n\t     \n\t     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to \nreassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the \nForeign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the \nUnited States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, \nbut that, in order to do what we need to do together to \nstrengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States \nbe fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join \nthe NPT regime is critical.\n\t     \n\t     What was the second question?  \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and \nCOCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the \nRepublican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, \nas soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other \nrestrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on \nrelations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies \nof the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of \nthem we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the \nleadership of the Congress.\n\t     \n\t     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be \nan openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there \nare, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to \nemigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there \nis no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed \nto affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be \nmuch less.\n\t     \n\t     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing \nmore than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my \nown advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement \nout of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to \nbegin it in the fairly near future.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in \nAnnapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely \ndifferent personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not \npolitical approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of \nMr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the \ndifference between you as a personality and your approach -- the \ndifference between your approach to Russia and the approach of \nMr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the \nlast part of your speech?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to \ncompare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say \nwhat was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a \nboy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the \nmusic and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been \nthrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music \nfor more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists \nand many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know \nas much as I could about your history.  \n\t     \n\t     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then \nthe Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last \npresidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone \nin Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. \nYeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I \nwas following events there very closely and hoping for the day \nwhen we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a \npersonal feeling about Russia.  \n\t     \n\t     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like \nmusic very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a \nmusician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York \nPhilharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony \nto the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly \nthan anyone had ever played it before because it was technically \nso difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it \noccurred.  \n\t     \n\t     These are things that have always had a big impact \non my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever \nhad the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two \ncountries become closer partners.

The OT game winner came from Dimitri\nYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS\nnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an\nNHL record 9th OT loss this season.\n\nRoster move:\n\nGord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill\n\nInjuries:\n\nRyan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-Hynes\n\nDominic Roussel\n\nGame Summary:\n\nI didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts\nI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by\na few things I did pick up:\n\nFirst Period:\n\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\n\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\nHar (interference) 18:43\n\nSecond Period:\n\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\n\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\n\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\n\nThird Period:\n\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\n\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\n\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\n\nOvertime:\n\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\nPenalties - None\n\nPower Play:\n\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\n\nGoalies:\n\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\n\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\n\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\n\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\n\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\nended up behind the goalie.\n\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\n\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\nwas that scored, much less how.\n\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\n\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\n\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\nnext season.\n\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\n\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\nNot a tough choice.\n\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\n\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\nin years to come.\n\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\n\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\n\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\n\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\n\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\n\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in\nnext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as\nmany goals as they allowed, 319.\n\nThe 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.\n\nI will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey\nNews that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have\nno other way of getting them.\n\nI hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have.

I know RK works by \nchanging the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of \neyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the \neyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's \nidea, right?)\n\nThanks for any information.\n\n\n", "From: jenkinch@ccmail.orst.edu\nSubject: Re: Adaptec SCSI Device Driver for Win3.1\nOrganization: University Computing Services - OSU\nLines: 1\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: jenkinsc.ads.orst.edu\n\n\n", "From: gballent@hudson.UVic.CA (Greg  Ballentine)\nSubject: Re: Plus minus stat...\nNntp-Posting-Host: hudson.uvic.ca\nReply-To: gballent@hudson.UVic.CA\nOrganization: University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada\nLines: 33\n\n\nIn article 1443@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca, maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca (Roger Maynard) writes:\n\n>Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team.

The keywords `Monthly Posting'\nwill always appear to make killing this article easy for users of\nnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos\ngroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't\nunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at\nleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please\nsubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the\ndocumentation provided there.\n\nIntroduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:\n\nrec.autos.tech\n\nis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,\nconstruction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely\ninappropriate, especially For Sale ads.\n\nrec.autos.sport\n\nis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving\nautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply\nto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,\nspectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are\nlargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are\ninappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.\nDiscussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid\nadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)\n\nrec.autos.driving\n\nis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.\nAlso, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert\nyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.\n\nrec.autos.vw\n\nis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership\nof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,\nSeats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing\nlist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\na mailing list.\n\nrec.audio.car\n\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\nso is mentioned here.\n\nrec.autos.antique\n\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\n\nalt.hotrod\n\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\nperformance vehicles.\n\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\n\nalso not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\n\nalt.autos.karting\n\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\n\nrec.autos\n\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\n\n\nCrossposting:\n\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\n\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\n\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\n\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\n\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\nrec.autos.\n\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\n\nDistribution:\n\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\n\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\nheaders, and on article content.\n\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\n\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\nspread of misinformation.\n\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\n\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\n\"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\nto be supported in your area.\n\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\n\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\n\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\n\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\nquite useless.\n\n\nConcerning Lemons:\n\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all\n`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\nthe `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\ninformation.\n\n\nConcerning Flames:\n\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\nof this posting):\n\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a\nminute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and\nyou'll get exactly what you deserve.\n\nIf you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\nbald, unsupported assertions.\n\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\n\n\nAsking the Question:\n\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\nsend email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\nI'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses\nto this request'.\n\nAnswering the Question:\n\nIf someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.\nEither be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on\ndefending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --\nit's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly\naddress the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see\nyour words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and\nself-righteous.\n\n\nStale and/or Inflammatory Topics:\n\nCertain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of\nthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings\nabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them\nignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is\ndifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some\nof these topics include the following:\n\n1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con\n\n2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of\n    radar detectors.\n\n3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.\n\n4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why\n    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue\n    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)\n\n5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's\n    right to own and operate a radar detector\n\n6)  `Buy American' discussions\n\n7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates\n\n8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible\n\n9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?\n      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the\n          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.\n          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]\n\n\n\nPlease direct comments and suggestions about this article to:\n\n     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n", "From: daw@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu (Dave Webb)\nSubject: Gameboy games: Trade for Genesis, Game Gear or Gameboy Games (Uupdate)\nOrganization: Homewood Academic Computing, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md, USA\nLines: 30\nDistribution: na\nNNTP-Posting-Host: jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu\n\nI have the following GameBoy Games available for TRADE!\n\nPitfighter\nMetroid II\nBases Loaded\nBlades Of Steel\nMalibu Beach Volleyball\nWorld Cup Soccer\nTennis..\nSpiderman\nRobocop\nMotocross Maniacs\nDouble Dribble 5 on 5 Basketball\n\n\nLooking for:\nGenesis Games\nMissile Command (Gameboy) \nGame Gear games\n\nPlease leave e-mail if interested!\n\t\n\t\tThanx\n\t\t\tDave Webb\nP.S.\nI'm still waiting to hear from Allen Thoren Jr. about trading MB Volleyball for\nMissile Command...

Some of them probably\ndidn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit\nthey wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or\nsomething.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they\nreport every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating\nthat the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough\nliability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to\nhappen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information\non a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the\nAMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.\nThere are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking.\nPatients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks\nto themselves properly.

Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the\nthreat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger\nusing a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim \nin an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not\nbe as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually\n_use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.)\nIt isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a\nknife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more\ncommon. That's why it is important to look at the overall\n(not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of\nsubstitution, different criminal techinques of using different\nweapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.\n\n>As for knives, see my earlier post.  I'd much rather face a knife\n>than a gun, thanks.  \n\n\"Face\"? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't\ntoo common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the\nusual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts\nto much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your\npockets.

If faced with a serious threat, almost\nall prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore,\nusing (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case)\na weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless\nof how he is armed.

The documentation\nis no help at all. As an example, it says 'The serial port can be changed to\nCOM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-(\n\nThere are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows:\nC1\nC2\nS2\nP2\nP1\nG\n\nThe second bank is labeled \"IRQ\" and has the following labels:\n5C\n5S\n4\n3\n3S\n2C\n2S\n\nI have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first\nserial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer\nport as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the \"G\" enables the game port and\nthe \"S2\" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can't get it to work. I\nhave tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success.

All they\ncare about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,\nafter all IS the bottom line. \n\n\tSecond, if I look at all the people I know who use any form\nof encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who\nstill insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people \nlooking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think\nof anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves\ntheir methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make\nmistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are\njust as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. \n\n\tThird, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly\nfamiliar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption\nstratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that\nsomeone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.\nThat despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can \nnot see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.\n\n\tFourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid\npeople out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the \nbuilt in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to\ndo any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going\nto run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start\nlooking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. \n\n\n\tIf nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,\nthe truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into\nsimply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything\nelse. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do\nnot think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be\nslowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to \nconvert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,\nthe Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.\n\n\n\tThe bottom line here is that people will use what works, and\nunavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption\nrelated charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty\ncharges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.\n\tThe other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide \nuseage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is\nout of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box\nhas been opened), and this is not going to change.

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-\nger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the \nphysical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had \nan awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas\nornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this \nwent on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and \nwas in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into\ntears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .\n\nThen someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I \nwant to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am \nsilent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling\nme, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the\none whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, \ntelling him, \"I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring \nher corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse.\" He went and returned empty\nhanded, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his \napartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were \nwalking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls. \nThere was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.\n\nThey started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I \nwent down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the\napartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be \ncowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the \ndoors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, \nopened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle \nSabir's son started to shout, \"Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!\" He \nknocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. \nAunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their \napartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying\ndelirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.\nAll of my family had gathered there.\n   \nAt the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the\napartment.\n\nLater I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \"Lyuda, \nKarina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes \nyou, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful.\" It was as though\nher whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one \nside, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her \ncheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole\nmicrodistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, \"Fine.\" Mamma was \nafraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started \nto cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the\nbed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye \nthat was intact, looked at me, and said, \"Who is it?\" But I could barely talk, \nmy whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something\ntender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \"My Karochka, my Karina, my \nlittle golden one . . . \" She understood me.\n\nThen Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips. \nShe started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't \nunderstand it. Then I made out, \"It hurts, I hurt all over.\" Her hair was \nglued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her \nforehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how \nto help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's\nsaying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil \nand paper and says, \"Write it down.\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I \ncan't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me \nsomething, but she couldn't. I say, \"Karina, just lie there a little while,\nthen maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then.\" And then she says,\n\"Maybe it'll be too late.\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't\ncontrol myself.\n\nThen I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped\na handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She \nsays, \"Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this \ndamned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need\nto call Urshan.\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I \nunderstood her every word. I ask, \"What's his number?\" Urshan Feyruzovich, \nthat's the head of the administration where she works. \"We have to call him.\" \nBut I didn't know his home number. I say, \"Karina, what's his number?\" She \nsays, \"I can't remember.\" I say, \"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\" She \nsays, \"I don't know anything, leave me alone.\"\n\nI went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was \ncrying, too. I say, \"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can \nwe call him? Who knows his telephone number?\" I tell Marina, \"Think, think, \nwho can we call to find out?\" She started calling; several people didn't \nanswer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and \nfound out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he \nwas at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says, \n\"Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and \ntell them that they just can't do that.\" She still didn't know what was really\ngoing on. I said, \"It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's \nhappening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single \nArmenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised \nthat we managed to save ourselves. \"She says, \"Well, OK, if it's that serious \n. . . \" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up \nand that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. \"OK, \nfine, fine,\" she says, \"if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back \nI'll send him over.\"\n\nWe called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly \nunder Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She \nwasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed \neverything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on\ntrying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and \nfinally we get through. She says, \"Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your \nplace now.\" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either, \nbecause he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep \nwith his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what \nshape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has \ngrown up daughters, they're almost my age.\n\nThe three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and\nwent down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, \nfirst they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As\nsoon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said\nthat we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have\nfractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the\nfirst floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around\neleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I \nsaw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies\n. . . everything just like a war.\n\nThey carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical\npeople from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older \nArmenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud \nshe would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \nArkady, I think, because someone said \"Arkady, get an injection ready,\" he \nstarted to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \nwhen he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \nsixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \nstarted to cry: \"What have they done to you?!\" He was speaking Armenian. \"What\nhave they done to you?!\" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and \nshe started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \"I'll give you a shot.\" \nMamma tells him, \"I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \nare they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people,\nand you're just sitting here!\" Some teacups were standing on the table in \nthere. \"You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my \ndaughters! Look what they've turned them into!\" They gave her something to \ndrink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\ndoctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \nand Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \nout. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \ndon't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: \"What's \nthe matter with you?\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\nin the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's.\nI said, \"I'm fine.\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \nthe doctor, \"You leave, let a woman examine her.\" A woman came, an \nAzerbaijani, I believe, and said, \"What's wrong with you?\" I was wearing my \nsister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \nshe was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \nbe easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\nher. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \nwound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \nsomething to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \ndressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.\n\nThey put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \nI raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't \nknow if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \"Lie still, you mustn't move.\" When\nI was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \nvery familiar to me. I shouted, \"Stop!\" One of the policemen turned and says, \n\"What do you want?\" I say, \"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\" They \nbrought him over and I said, \"That person was just in our apartment and he \njust raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\" They said, \n\"Fine,\" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were \ntaking him.\n\nThen they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \nsitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \nup closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \"Sister . . . \" I don't \nremember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\ndid to us. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said that he was from Ufa. \nApparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \nlearned that they suffered most of all. He says, \"OK, you're Armenians, they \ndidn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,\" he says, \"what are they trying \nto kill me for?\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \nbalcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \ntwo Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \nagainst the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\nwith his own club. The way he cried \"Mamma\" made my skin crawl. I don't know \nwhat they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before \nhe attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\nthird or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was \nAzerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\nwere throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with \nsomeone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \nyard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\nI realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\n\nThey took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \nand said, \"I've been beaten too, help me.\" But they just ignored her. My \nfather went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \nthat he'd been beaten, and says, \"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \nprobably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\" The doctor says, \"That's not my\njob.\" Urshan said, \"Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \nI'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \nto his apartment.\n\nMarina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \ndoctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \nwasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\nsurprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\nHippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\ncoincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\nhaving examined Karina, said, \"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \nthey did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\n\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she\nwould certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \nstory. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \ndrugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon\nfound out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\nthey started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \nzoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \nseeing it.\n\nThey put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have \nany serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \nplace, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \nher daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\nIra was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\nWhen they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \ninvoluntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again.\nHer daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful \nwhen I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \"Do what\nyou want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\" Well, they did what they \nwanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \nwould be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \nwas simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \nevery day: steal, kill, rape . . .\n\nMany are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts \nexplained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \nchildren would be grown, and then, as they put it, \"we'll come take the \npleasure out of their lives, those children.\" This was about the girls that\nwould be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \nbecause they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\nas there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \nof some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \nvictims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that\nthey would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\nthemselves said that.\n\nAnd this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many \npeople say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know \nwhy their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, \nmaybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and \nthey weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \nnothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \nMarina: \"Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over \nthere [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman \nshouldn't see such things.\" So they were really quite sober . . .\n\nSo we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \nhappened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several \nhours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\nhappened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk-\ning to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he\nthought no one is listening: \"Listen,\" he'll say, \"what could I do? What could\nI do alone, how could I protect them?\" I don't know where to find the words,\nit's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen. \nThat's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \ncourse he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail\nof what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\ntogether in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\npresent at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\nwhen the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.\n\nOn February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\nFirst they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \nthe soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \nThere were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \nthere. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \nwere sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife \nand Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\n\nThen they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\nThere's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\nThey took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\nthat they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\nso dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\nThe women were shouting. They explained to them: \"We want to hide you\nbetter because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\"\n\nWe went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\nhad children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \nhave their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \nThey kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \ncould see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \npolice precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \nsurrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were \nstanding on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \ngreat psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't \njust walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48,\nor those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \nfamily members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \nwhen all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single\nperson, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\nhave already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \nroom down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\none another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \npeople, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\nthe end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \nhospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \nparents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \nattack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \nArmenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \nshe wouldn't be able to take it.\n\nThen soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \nclimbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\nThey all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \ncalmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \nlittle cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\nto the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \nhave occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people \ndo eat.\n\nThen, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \nwere being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \nthe courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \ndifferent woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \nand calling out: \"Oh, Rafik!,\" but when she heard about this such a rage came \nover her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \nsleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \nsoldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\nstanding there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\nto one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \nhim! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \none of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \ndoing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \nmuttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\nappeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\nwas over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \nterribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \ncreeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \nthis the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She \nwent five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \n\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \nraped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though \nnothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?\" She appealed to everyone, but no \none got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I \ncould barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \nmany hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already\nafter ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the \nelderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \nThere was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \nThe situation was deplorable.\n\nAt eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \nAzerbaijanis. They said, \"Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up\nand put the children to bed.\" Now the women didn't want to leave this place, \neither. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \ndogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \"Oh, it's our little \nfamily,\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \nthe first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\nspoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\nmachine guns in their hands, said, \"Grandmother, you mustn't approach me,\nI'm on guard.\" Our people would say, \"Oh, that's all right.\" They hugged\nthem, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\nmoving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\n\nThey took us up to the second floor and said, \"You can undress and sleep in \nhere. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.\"\nThis was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\nplaces. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\nSK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \nasked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\nI didn't know what was happening there. They told me, \"Don't worry, the\nMaternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\nassured. I say, \"Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in\nthere is capable of anything.\"\n\nWhen I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\nalready been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\ntal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\nwe were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \nacquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \nhadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \nthem, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \ncome their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \nthey had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \nhungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \ncourse the stories and the talk were flying: \"Oh, I heard that they killed \nhim!\" \"What do you mean they killed him!\" \"He stayed at work!\" \"Do you know \nwhat's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\n\nAnd then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \nwell and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small \nroom, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \ntalking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \nof the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \nBagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \nfrom outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \nhim things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \nsoldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with \nthe people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\n\nSeveral hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \"Lyudochka, find another \ntwo or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \nlists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \nwho had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\" I \nhad about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \"Lyuda, your \nMamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are \nalive and well and that you're here.\" I gave the lists to someone and asked \nthem to continue what I was doing and went off.\n\nThe list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's\nfather, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\nGrigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \nname of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \nthat he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\nof the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \nit turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\nsomehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \nKrasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \nin addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \nmissing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\n\nAll the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were \ncontained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \nof minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \"What's \ngoing on?\" He said, \"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\nthey are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\n[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\nof the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\nhim, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\nwas one or fifty.\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they\nshould ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over\nagain. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\nwas the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\nthat's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \npeople on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \na half of those that were on the first list. He said, \"Lyuda, please, try to\nremember at least one more.\" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there\nwere more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\ndon't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \nwhose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of\nthe Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many \npeople left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\nin Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \nKrasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that \nthere are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \nKrestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \ncows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \nto help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\nthe city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \nAzerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's\nmore. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \ndrawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\ndon't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \npublicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, \nthey simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them\nis the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \n8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know \nher name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \nMicrodistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the \nsame landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \nthe door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and \nwhen she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her \nbraid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \nthey didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \n. . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.\n\nThey transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for\ndays in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \nand I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina; \nit was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \nalready walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \nsocial work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \n\"If it weren't for the work I would go insane.\" He and I put ourselves in gear\nand took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \nand free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \nalthough we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \ndispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \nwas free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\nto see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\nvisible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\n\nOn March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\nFedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered \nonly Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.\nMother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.\n\nShirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \ntold him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and\nrecord everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. \nWe didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the\nconditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \nquality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there \nweren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \ncurfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \nvideo cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that \nwe can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \nto draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\nthat the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \nSumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \nBibishev, I told him myself, \"Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two \nmonths, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in\nthose two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.\"\n\nHe and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I\ngave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to\nher, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\nself. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\nrays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat\nand drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\nwere in Baku already, the investigator told me, \"How long can you go on like \nthis? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're\nnot taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\ninvestigation through. We need you.\" Then I started eating, because in fact I\nwas exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\nment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement\ncells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in\nevery prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\nSumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary \nconfinement.\n\nThus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma \nidentified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify \nanyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the \nphotographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one \nwho went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the \nloose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know \nhis first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \nsisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that \neven if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will \ncontinue looking for him.\n\nThe 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various \nplants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.\nMostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only\none of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and\nChemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-\ntor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front\nof me \"I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash\nsimply for keeping him out of Armenia,\" that is, to keep him from landing in\na prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the\ninvestigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even\nthough we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological\npressure--they say, \"Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an\nArmenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you\nin short order.\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.\n\nThe investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\npogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then\nthat I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \nin our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \nall the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned \nthem, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials\nfrom the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \nFenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \nboiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had \nbeen in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's \nenough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't\neven know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did \ntake worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out \nslippers.\n\nOf those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \nBasically, the group that went seeking \"revenge\"--let's use their word for \nit--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with \none of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that \nblack I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking\npart in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of \nTamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently\narrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I \ndon't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an \nAzerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know \nnothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an \naxe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and \nthrew them into the tub with water.\n\nI remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You \nknow, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both \ntheir hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-\neyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I \nidentified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born\nin the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How \ndid I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I \nkept thinking, is that Rita or \"puma,\" which it would be if you read the word \nas Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \"T\" was the one \nthat looks like a Latin \"M.\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind\nhis back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to\nput in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and \ntold me that I was making a mistake, and called me \"dear sister.\" He said, \n\"You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an \nArmenian,\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator \nasked me, \"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\" I told him, \"I'll tell you one more\nidentifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \nname Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\" He went rigid and became \npale. They told him, \"Put your hands on the table.\" He put his hands on the\ntable with the palms up. I said, \"Now turn your hands over,\" but he didn't \nturn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\nacknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they \nforced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\nBut he insolently stuck to his story, \"No, I did not do anything, it wasn't \nme.\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\nhand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\ninto a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \nof granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \nCatching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\nand the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \nback. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how, \nbut I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \nstrangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \nmicrophone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\nlast name, and he says, \"Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\n\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \nThey took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \nbecause we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \"You're \nsome actress! What a performance!\" I said, \"Tolya, honestly . . . \" Beforehand\nthey would always tell me, \"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \nnothing had happened to you.\" I say, \"I don't have any more strength or \nemotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \n. . . I don't have the strength to do anything.\" And he says, \"Lyuda, how were\nyou able to do that?\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\nthe tape, I said, \"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \nthat high in gym class.\"\n\nSo you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \nthe 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \nbeat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\n\nAt the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \nguilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\nthem were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \n\"Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\no'clock.\" He said, \"No, I'm not coming.\" They told him, \"If you don't come \nwe'll kill you.\" He said, \"Alright, I'll come.\" And he went.\n\nThey also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\nhad also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \nmotorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \nout of his apartment and told him the same thing: \"Tomorrow we're going to get\nthe Armenians. Be there.\" He said, \"No.\" They pulled a knife on him. He said, \n\"I'm not going all the same.\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \nhim several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\nin the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \nwe would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\n\nI'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\nbeat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\nwas very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\nhim, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\nof Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our \napartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our \napartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \ndon't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked\nout very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina\nbecause he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\ncourtyard, he remained in the apartment.\n\nAt one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\nI learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't \nhave a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\nand, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\nwith bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\n\nThe others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't\ncall them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\nsomeone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, \"I don't \nunderstand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\" But we know that\nthey were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the\nname of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\nthat's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do.\nBecause I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their\nlevel of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\nwork, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \ncrowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \npromised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\nSo off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \"they \npromised us apartments.\"\n\nAmong them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\nheart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \nchildren's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \nthe children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \nhave they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or \ngrandparents. And he said, \"I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how\nI ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \nown, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\" And the whole time I\nkept repeating, \"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \nright before your own eyes.\" He sat there and just wailed.\n\nBut that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \nmarvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just \nhave to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\ngrandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \nto cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \nknew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed \nhimself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.\n\nThat one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr \nGambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \"Let's go, enough, you've spilled\nenough blood here.\"\n\nMaybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was \nthat they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\nand her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \nliked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \nKarina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors \nold me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \nthe entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \nalready at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back\nand started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \nsustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \nwoman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \nKarina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\nThe woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \nand led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \nhe sees everything, and He won't forgive this.\n\nThere was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \nfloor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\ncustom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\nBut they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \ntantamount to trampling a woman's honor.\n\nNow that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \nhave gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \nevents that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \nabout? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that \nwithout a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \nhave happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\nlet other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \nnations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \na people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\nwhat they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\nunleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they \nthrew themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\nto snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\nFebruary 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \nwho had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\nfor their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\nas far away as their legs would carry them.\n\nFebruary 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \ninto my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \nbeen a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \na meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \nteachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \nseven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \nwere a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \nevening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \nthe crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \nmicrophone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \ndriver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\nchild off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\nseen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \"Death to the Armenians! They must\nbe killed!\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because \npeople were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \nwoman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \ncut her daughters' breasts off, and called, \"Sons, avenge my daughters!\" That \nwas enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \ndirection of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\n\nWe stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \nvery nationalist speech. He said, \"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\" This \nhe repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \nstormily, whistling and shouting \"Karabagh!\" He said, \"Karabagh has been our \nterritory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \nheart?\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \"It's our \nterritory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \nFrom time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\ntime immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \nthe Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\" By filth he meant \nArmenians.\n\nI heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely.\nMany people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \nthe other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate,\nthat in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\nteachers said, \"Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's \nspouting,\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \nlistened to the woman's speech.\n\nRight then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \nsubject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\nstudies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\nhad considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \nobtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\n\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \nthey find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I \ntell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?\" When he \nsaid it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \nsecond time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\nafter eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \n\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until \ntwelve. Stay here.\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \nkindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \"I left my \nchildren at the kindergarten.\" The director excused her. When she let her go I\nturned around, said, \"Good-bye,\" and left with the young teacher, the \nAzerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.\n\nWhen we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran\nnearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \nmuch for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \noff. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \nwouldn't say that I was an Armenian.\n\nTo make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \nthe movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\nagain my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched \ntelevision as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \nday. That's how it all was.\n\nAt the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\nZhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \non Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \ndoesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \nheld the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \nground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went \nout on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \nentryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \nthere. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the \nmoment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been \ninjured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \nand their children: any way they could. \n\nWhere it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin, \nArmen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \nwhat was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \nanother immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \nwith muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \ntheir old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \nthem right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \nelectricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \nthey took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an \nAzerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\nand told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \nescape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of \ncourse, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\nthing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \nArmenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \npersonnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\nled everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \npersonnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \nvery moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.\n\nI heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big, \nstrong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \nstrong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\n\nOne of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \nfor the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \npeople hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \ndead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \nwith the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \nAzerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \nput down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \ninfection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \nneighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \ncame up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \nbasement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\ncarried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \nas one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \ntook his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \nseemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \nof ours he had managed to \"save.\"\n\nRaya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \nthemselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\nAzerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some \nreason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just \nvictims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \nIn the TV show \"Pozitsiya\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \nthe Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not \nimportant, the truth will come out regardless.\n\nSo that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \nbravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \nyears and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've \nbecome, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\n\nOn that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\nthat it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\nreceived by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \nwill depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \nProcuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\ntion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \nthe street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear\nspeaking our native tongue.\n\n   October 15,1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t\t- - - reference for #008 - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

I have a lot of fonts that I can\ninstall either as Type-1 PostScript (under ATM) or as TrueType.

After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed\nPeter, James, and John to \"tell the vision to no \nman, until the Son of man be risen again from \nthe dead\" (Matt. 17:9).  \nIf we were living at the time of Savior, there\nwould be no (public) record of this event.\n\n2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision \nof \"paradise\" when he \"heard unspeakable words, \nwhich it is not lawful for a man to utter\"\n(2 Cor. 12:4).\nThis person heard something which Paul can not \nwrite to the Corinthians (and us).\n\n3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of\nMormon where words uttered by \"babes\" were \n\"forbidden that there should not any man write\nthem (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows\nfor those of you without access to the BOM).\n\n3 Nephi 26:16\nBehold, it came to pass on the morrow that the \nmultitude gathered themselves together, and they\nboth saw and heard these children; yea, even \nbabes did open their mouths and utter marvelous\nthings; and the things which they did utter were\nforbidden that there should not any man write them.\n\nSome LDS scholars speculate that these words\nwhich could not be written are the sacred\nportions from temple we are to withhold from \nthe world (but it could be something else).\n\n>I\n>can understand why Mormons would limit temple access to only faithful\n>Mormons, but I have never understood the emphasis on shrouding temple\n>ritual in mystery.  \n\nThere is much we can discuss about the temple \nordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptisms\nand other vicarious ordinances for the dead.\nWe can discuss certain concepts regarding the\nendowment (\"the ritual\").\nHowever, there are certain elements I can not\ndiscuss with anyone (including other saints)\noutside of the temple.\nAs a portion of the endowment, we receive the\ntokens and signs that will permit us access\nto Heaven.  I must keep this knowledge sacred \nand respect the conditions under which it is\nrevealed to me.\n\nA IDLER\n", "From: casper@vxcrna.cern.ch (CASPER,DAVI./PPE)\nSubject: Re: American Jewish Congress Open Letter to Clinton\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    \nOrganization: European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN\nLines: 84\n\nIn article <C5vBnv.CJ@blaze.cs.jhu.edu>, arromdee@jyusenkyou.cs.jhu.edu (Ken Arromdee) writes...\n>In article <22APR199300374349@vxcrna.cern.ch> casper@vxcrna.cern.ch (CASPER,DAVI./PPE) writes:\n>> [I complained about the US taking the point in Bosnia, when the Europeans\n>>  should be doing it]\n>  [Ken says the Bosnians are morally superior to the Serbians...] \n\n>This implies both sides are equal.

The US tried basically that in Vietnam, the Iraqis\nin Kuwait, the Israelis in Palestine, South Africa, etc, etc, etc.  It sucks,\nit's ugly, and it's saddening.

Dr. Noordewier has \nappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and \nhas extensive experience in basic biological research in addition \nto his current work in computational biology.\n\n12:00-2:45pm \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for \n Biologists\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)\n\nAn overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be \npresented, as it relates to actual and potential biological \napplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming \nlanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as \nselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge \nrepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended \naudience includes biologists with some computational background, \nbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. \nLathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has \nworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to \nbiological problems in both academia and industry.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory \n in Biological Sequence Analysis\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos \n National Laboratory) \n\nThis tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of \nintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine \nlearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely \ninterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical \nneural networks to elicit both specific signals and general \ncharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such \napproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic \nviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical \nDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such \ntechniques in this domain.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\" \n Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)\n\nThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly \nnon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally \ninspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both \nthe biological motivations, and the actual implementation and \ncharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an \nextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size \nand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will \nalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to \nbiological applications, and to identifying resources and software \nthat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, \na Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught \nthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in \nthe field.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\" \n Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) \n & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)\n\nApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies \nare increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of \ntools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic \npattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of \ngenetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the \nidentification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes \nin sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and \nfunctional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty \nappointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, \nrepresents the branch of this field that considers higher-order \nsyntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski \nhas studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area \nof word-based analyses.\n\n                      REGISTRATION FORM\nMail, with check made out to \"ISMB-93\", to:\n\n               ISMB Conference, c/o J.

The scenario you outline is reasonably \nconsistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does\nnot support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by\nlatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for\nabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at\nmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life\nhas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before\nthere were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...\nmostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just\nfossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows\nthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what\nbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then\nhow could it exist before humans?\n\n>                             God created the original genetic code\n>perfect and without flaw.

I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about\nbiology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There\nis no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off'\nin perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a\ncollective sense.

It is a bad combination.\n\n Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and\nbacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',\n(forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer.

I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\nseems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\n\n>This may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you\n>are prepared to accept, but God is not responsible for disease.\n>Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of\n>disease, evolution by random chance would have produced them since\n>humanity forsook God's protection.\n\n Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the\nphrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect'\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\nperfect system. At least, IMHO.\n Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a\nbunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the\noriginal genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in\ninferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?\nIf so, why could God not have used better materials?\n Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,\nof did It just choose not to?\n\n[deletions]\n>In summary, newborns are innocent, but God does not cause their suffering.\n\n My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for\nthe explanation you give.

The offical number is 43 but\n  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I've also\n  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd\n  assert that I claimed they were truth.\n\nYes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. \nArmy tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's\nwithout it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on\nit and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying\n\"this has gone far enough.\"  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis\nfor my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. \nNot one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and\neverybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it\nhad happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own\nresearch failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is\nextraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. \nUnless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I\ndo not.\n\nI wrote:\n  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \n\nAwesley wrote:\n     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \n  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \n  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\n  So it would have been an Army cover-up.\n\nQuibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has\ntaught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half\ndecades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said \"yes, I\nshelled Americans,\" or \"I gave the orders to fire the cannons,\" or \"I\nhelped cover it up\"?\n\nI wrote:\n  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I\nprefer\n  to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\n  those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\n\nAwesley replied:\n    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe\n  that they did fire their guns.\n\nGood.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. \nYour belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?\n\nAwesley concludes:\n     Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\n  this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the\n  account I cited.\n\nActually, now we have established that I don't believe what you believe, as\nwell as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring, then I yield the last\nword to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with\nimpunity--I am dropping the subject.\n\n--John L.

Does it already exist?\n\nWhile I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF, \nfrom what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for \nstrong cryptography through a distinct organization.\n\nThe EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex\nand pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the\ncontents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged\nmodels) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin\nalready raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one\nstep removed from the old \"crypto-wielding child molester\" argument.  An\nEFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the\nconnection to child pornography and the like.\n\nSimilarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In\nlight of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it\nstands to be labelled as \"communist\", \"anarchist hackers\", radical, etc.  \n\nI don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social\nResponsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical\nantinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political\nbaggage.\n\nPerhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography\nwould best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing\ngroup, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to\nadvocacy for the right to cryptography.

Because You never get all thermic energy out of  \nthe powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  \nof the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  \noil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  \nthe turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  \nsteam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  \nsomething else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  \ntype of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  \nunobjectionable).

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have \nwith it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for\nothers who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just \nChristian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems\nwithin Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters\nof personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by\nobjective means.  \n\nChoosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal \nsovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these \nmatters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them \nbut are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this\nthat God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus \nanyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing\nthe wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the\nhonest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God.\nEven a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is\nuniversalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud\nnotion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that\nleads to arrogance.

Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and\nothers are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations\ncannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be\ndisabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.

In April \n1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A \nnumber of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German\nofficials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian\nPaikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.\nPaikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his\nArmenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the\ncreation of an Armenian SS formation in order \n\n\"to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the \n spirit of the Nazi ideas.\"\n\nHe wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories\nof the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish\nhomeland.

He played an important role in the\nestablishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any \nofficial position. His views were represented by his men in the\nrespective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro\nand Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.\nDro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after\na long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to\nBerlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] \n\nA minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not\n'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.\nAs such, they were subject to German racism.

Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(\ntoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well \nbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got \ninto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium \nwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here.\nBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 \nsupplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).\n\nVitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams \nper day).\n\n\t1. Review Article \"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney \n\t   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.\n\t   5(3):110-129(1985).\n\nBut glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both \nglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this \nproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, \nbut to increase your intake of vitamin B6.\n\n\t2. \"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in \n\t    patients with kidney stones\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)\n\t    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary \n\t    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.\n\n\t3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\" Clin. Sci. 38\n\t   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day \n\t   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.\n\nFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is \nrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for \noxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is \nquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  \nThe pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% \nof the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable \nand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto \n6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic \nacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the \nextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a \nvery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. \nMed. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day \nincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg \nper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was \nincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose \nand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion \nbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average \nbefore supplementation.\n\nB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There \nare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about \nyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the \nspeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must \nhave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then \nexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C \nchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your \nintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you \ntake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient \nin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate \nkidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets \nabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day \nshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309\n-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase \nin urinary oxalate excretion.\n\n\tHere are the high oxalate foods:\n\n\t1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.\n\t   Contain at least 25mg/100grams\n\n\t2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, \n\t   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.\n\t   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.\n\nIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot \nof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points \nout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your \nintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being \nabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't \nhave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for \nmales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more \nper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  \n\nThe USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day \nfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with \nthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 \nrequirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that \neither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 \nexcretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,\nisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to \nsupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that \nincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking \nbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the \nother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your \ndietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone \nformation should be given B6 supplements.\n\nOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your \nCa/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is \ncalcium-oxalate.\n\n\t4. \"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of \npatients with calcium oxalate calculi\"Invest.

Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).\n\nThere are actually about three times as many articles published in the \nmedical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone \nformation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in \nstating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier \npost in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I \nguess that he doesn't read the medical literature.

They are now also distributed through the \nnewsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in \ntheir source distributions of X11.\n\n\tPeople without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has \n23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].

That means that you mail \nit a request, and it mails back the response.\n\tAny of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The\nxstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can \nhave several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). \nThe xstuff server treats the \"Subject:\" header line just like any other line \nof the message.\n\tThe archives are organized into a series of directories and \nsubdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an \nindex. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the \nsubdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.\n\n\t1) The command \"help\" or \"send help\" causes the server to send you a \nmore detailed version of this help file.\n\t2) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"index\", then \nthe server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If\nthere are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then \nthe indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. \nFor example, you can say \"send index fixes\" (or \"index fixes\"). A message that \nrequests an index cannot request data.\n\t3) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"send\", then the\nxstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name \nan item, you give its directory and its name. For example\n                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9\n\tYou may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many \nsafeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large \namounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed\namount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the \nday's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. \nWhenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out \nshortest-first.\n\t4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting \nreturn addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If \nyou happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like\n        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu\nor\n        path bar!foo!frotz\nin the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.\n\n\tThe xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If \nyour mailer deals in \"!\" notation, try sending to \n{someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.\n\n[based on information from the MIT X Consortium, 8/89, 4/90.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  60)!

It is my opinion that most educated\nor well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government.\nThis should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time\nwill tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was \ncreated for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line.\nThat and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press\nportrays a group of people as \"nuts\" or crazies, a violation of those\npeople's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the \ngurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the\n2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk \nvoted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with\ndomocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.\n  Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the \nofficial press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to\npublic safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information.\nSo far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very\nagency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their\nadvantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they\nwere portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification\nwhat so ever of doing what they did.\n   So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny,\nmay mislead the public from the truth of the matter.\n\nJust as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton\nleads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's\n(in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be\nunconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least).\nAnd since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved\nin this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to \nfind out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA.\nIt would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly\nunconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement). \n\n\n****************************************************************************\nThe above opinions are mine and mine only.\nI'm solely responsible for my opinions and my actions.

He has\nbrought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions -- players that\nwere from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros.  I don't\nthink that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team\nas he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball.\nMcLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid point\nthat injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the\nbench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid\noutfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The\npitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  We're dealing with a young\nHouston team, so injuries shouldn't play a big role.

Chiu knows the score and is just being\nsilly. However, \"decibel\" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is\nright on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.\n\nStrictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels,\nand a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel,\nhence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).\n\nThe bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are\nall named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine\nway to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field.\nHertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers,\nbut had been left out in having a term or unit named after him\nuntil recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.)\nAll the other units were defined many decades earlier.\n\n\n \n\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n", "From: jburnside@ll.mit.edu (jamie w burnside)\nSubject: Re: GOT MY BIKE!

For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS\nand Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.\n\nThat said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display\non a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port\nwhich can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say\nyou hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could\nput in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.\nYou could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to\nmix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could\nhave 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,\nor 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any\ncombination.\n\nBecause of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use\nof the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different\nin meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.\n\nThe reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12\nscreens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server\nthat determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,\nMAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,\nthis is 12.\n\nAs such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.\nX server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X\nI'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is\nnot the case.\n\nWe just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of\ncourse, I could say \"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\"\n-- \n----\nRusty Sanders, Megatek Corp. --> rgs@megatek.com or...\n         ...ucsd!    ...hplabs!hp-sdd!    ...ames!scubed!   ...uunet!\n", "From: shz@mare.att.com (Keeper of the 'Tude)\nSubject: Re: Riceburner Respect\nOrganization: Office of 'Tude Licensing\nNntp-Posting-Host: binky\nLines: 11\n\nIn article <oXZ12B1w164w@cellar.org>, craig@cellar.org (Saint Craig) writes:\n> No anyone who is a \"true\" rider with the real riding attitude will offer a\n> wave, weather they are on a Harley or on a Honda or some other bike, inless\n> they have a serious case of my bike is better than your and you're too low\n> to be acknowleged.

(Tells us who is going to be in the chip business if\nthis thing goes through--NSA, and those with something to hide from\nNSA.)\n\n  If anyone can verify that your phone is not using the key registered\nto that serial number, either:\n\n  1) They have a court ordered wiretap.  But what are they going to\ndo?  Tell the judge that this individual really does have privacy?\nAll they know is that the keys are not enough, but not why.\n\n  2) They have a court ordered wiretap on a phone in this series.\n(This part is really scary.  Since the \"expectation\" is that all\nchips in a particular batch will uses seeds based on the same S1 and\nS2 and the serial number, getting the keys for one of a batch may give\naccess to all.)\n\n  3) There is a backdoor which allows all messages to be deciphered\nwithout the keys.  I find this one especially threatening since the\nscheme seems very open to known plaintext attacks.  (What I need to\ndecipher is the data in the header.  If I talk to someone who has one\nof these phones, presumably there will be an automatically negotiated\nkey generated.  I'm not trying to decipher the record of the\nconversation to know what was said, I use it as a known plaintext to\nrecover the backdoor represented by the header, but I know what the\nheader says for conversations I participate in.  Even worse, if the\nphones in a series have related keys, I can buy a phone/chip from the\nsame production lot.  Then I can recover its keys, either elegantly by\ntalking to myself, or by brute force analysis of the actual chip, then\napply the key generation process with those seeds to find the target\nkeys.)\n\n    Hmmm!  I don't think I want to ever come close to these phones.\nEven DES is starting to look good.  Two cans and a string will provide\nmuch better security.\n\n\n\n--\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRobert I.

Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and\nthf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.\nI guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult\nfor them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my\nsysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his\ndefense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has\nbeen posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed\nat me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding\nvia netmail...)\n\nWhile I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin\nto get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post\nI made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not\nwhat the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I\nAM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him\naxed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. \"Argumentum\nad silence-your-opponent-um\"?! I would have thought he would have\nwanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and\nseem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).\n\nThe issue that seems to be: \"Is the following an advertisement?\"\nApparently, Ted and Mark think so...\n\n1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken \n\t*off the net* from last year. If reposting an article\n\tconstitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post\n\tdid have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one\n\thad posted the address and subscription price of \"Newsweek\",\n\twould that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.\n2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of\n\t\"proof\" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains\n\tto my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and\n\tbehold, \"poof\", there goes my account. This one had an\n\taddress in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!\n\nIf you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE\nITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send\na note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get\n\"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful...\" or whatever; they\nonly get \"I don't like what that user is doing because...\".\nPlease do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them\nin a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.\n\nIn my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying \"Thanks for\nthe info\" or \"Could you send me such and such?\" or \"Your posts are\nvery interesting... keep it up.\" and only a handfull of \"Go aways\". But,\nI guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to\nconvince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant\na message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...\"My name is Ted and\nand this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have\nsome pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...\")\nNWO Indeed!\n\nGuess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with\na new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.\nI will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks!\nYour comments and support are requested. I can no longer post\nto news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit\nfrom making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. \nSeems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side\nshut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the\nprocess of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that\na lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.\nOh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I\nwas just getting started.\n\nIt should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40\ntimes of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the\ncontrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed?\nWe all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people\non the net that are of \"interest\" to the government, and Ted sure seems\nto have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does\nhe work for? The University of Chicago which he \"attends\"(?) is well\nknown as one of the biggest NWO supporters...\n\nAnd finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here\nin the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the\nprocess of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe\na TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Since I\nam longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERY\nsoon, I hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via:\n\n\tA. J.

The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'\ncurve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a\nroom-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature \n5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.\n\nOils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have\na weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly\ncold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold\nplace, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,\nto approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.\n\nModern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.\nAs a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis\nspecification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating\ntemperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).\n\nIn any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember\nthat your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and\nradiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or\nsomething.\n\nAny weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized\noil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,\nthicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, \nbut not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  \n\nIf you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine\n(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives,\nstick to the 10W40.\n\n\n--\nDON'T DRINK SOAP! DILUTE DILUTE!

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000\nand that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,\nBritish Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There\nare also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here\nit's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid\nwithout a pair of skates.  And before you say \"what does he know? He's from\nCalifornia.\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,\na town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio\nplay by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were\nthe last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was\non skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational\nhockey for about 35 years.\n\n|> >When was the last time you saw a hockey league in the inner city.\n|> >The insurance alone is a big enough barrier.\n|> \n|> The inner city isn't the only place that is poor.\n|> I think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is... no ICE to play on.\n\n\nLack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for\nthe Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,\ncost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club\ndues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues\ncover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless\nthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.\n\nBy the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \"inner city\"\nareas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an\nindustrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther\nKing, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown\n(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west\nof 99.

At that village, whose name was publicized\nthroughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had\nfour killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was\nnearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab\ntroops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting\nwas thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated\nthroughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian\npopulation of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the\nbattle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed\nat the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,\nchildren and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the\nslopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw\naway the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own\nrisk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants\nobeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their\nstone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy\nwas murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent\ntestimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to\novercome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the\ncivilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable\ncasualties.\n\n    \"The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of\nrevolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We\nnever broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in\naccordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am\nconvinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single\nunnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw\nstones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do\nwell not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].\n\n    \"In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency\nfound it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.\nBen Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise\nruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise\nruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the\nbodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal\nsuperciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews\nwere all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of\n'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave\nof lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'\n\n    \"The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the\nresult it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.\nKolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the\nHaganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.\nBeit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main\nroad; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the\nHaganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the\nrest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even\nbefore they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir\nYassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the\nway to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir\nYassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the\nconquest of Haifa.\"\n\n\n[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) \"To counteract the loss\nof Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at\nRamallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by\nIrgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish\nofficials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this\nArab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced\nto reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of\nevil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of\nterror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at\nthe mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen\nbattalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie\nis still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.\"\n\n[2] In reference to denunciation of Dir Yassin by fellow Jews.\n", "From: grady@netcom.com (1016/2EF221)\nSubject: IDEA vectors?\nOrganization: capriccioso\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]\nLines: 11\n\nI am testing IDEA block cipher implementations for correctness\nand needs some golden test vectors.

The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.

But she\nknows I am a Christian. \n\nWell, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such\na thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid\nyou not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.\n\nIn out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding\ndates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her).\nShe has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended\nup leaving school....Now we are at the present...\n\nLet me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....\n\n\n\"Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not\ngoing to KU anymore because something just isn't right. College\njust wasn't clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and\nthat just isn't my way. I wasn't taking any classes that truly interested\nme & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was\ninterested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with \nkids, but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university. And my parents\ncould tell.\n\n\"So I'm working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now\nI have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room\nM-W-F. I've really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and \nit's great experience.\n\n\"As of now, I'm not planning on going back to school in the very\nnear future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to\nstudy. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of\nyears. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it won't be\nto Kansas.\n\n\"Right noew I'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district \nmanager. It looks like I'll train at the store I work at now for\nabout 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when that's done, I'll \nbasically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to \nchose where i would like to manage. I've pretty much decided on either\none of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn't it\nbe fun to actually see each other more than once every few years??\nWhat do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion.\n\n\"This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD pay\nand any thye of management experience would look good on an application\nor resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Good\nbenefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-time\nservice, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitng\nfor me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up \npaying out of state tuition wherever I go.\n\n\"Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I \nrespect your opinion. I've been completely lost for what to do for \nsoooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really \ngood. I do like my job although I'm about 99.9% sure that i want\nto do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something.\nI don't think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old female\nis too bad. \n\n\"Anyway, onto your career decisions. I'll solve your problem right now,\nMARRY ME...\n\n\"You can do your pilot thing-- I like to be by myself sometimes! Seriously\n(or not as seriously)- do what will make you the happiest, worry about the\nhome life later.\"\n\n***********\n\nOK, well I'm sure you see what has got me so uptight. What do you\nthink she meant about the marraige thing?? \n\nI dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in her\nletter!!! I don't know what to think??\n\nSince she wants to move to the Carolina's should i search out a \nBass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???\n\nI always pick on those people who graduate from high school and\nget married....but what does she mean??? \n\nI've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that \nI don't date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) that\nmost college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the\nGreeks whic as a Christian I can't support-----and here\nshe says she doesn't like the Greek thing either!!\n\nMaybe I'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am\nso attracted to paying some real attention to me.\n\nI mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? I'm\nonly 19 and she 20....I'm only a Sophmore struggling through\nclasses..\n\nI have prayed about this over the past year from time to time..\nsaying, \"God if she is the right one, let the situation open up..\"\n\nCould this be my sign???\n\nI would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes \nit worse..\n\nShould I call her?? I'm terrible over the phone. I don't even like\nto talk to my friends here for longer than 3 minutes.\n\nI mean, what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very\naverage guy like me??\n\nI'm really confused....I would really appreciate any help i can get.\n\nThanx \n\nChris\n\n[I have a feeling that it might be more appropriate to talk with\nChris directly via email.  --clh]\n", "From: I3150101@dbstu1.rz.tu-bs.de (Benedikt Rosenau)\nSubject: Re: Wholly Babble (Was Re: free moral agency)\nOrganization: Technical University Braunschweig, Germany\nLines: 10\n\nIn article <2944159064.5.p00261@psilink.com>\n\"Robert Knowles\" <p00261@psilink.com> writes:\n \n(Deletion)\n>Of course, there is also the\n>Book of the SubGenius and that whole collection of writings as well.\n \n \nDoes someone know a FTP site with it?\n   Benedikt\n", "From: rmohns@vax.clarku.edu\nSubject: RE: Win NT - what is it???\nOrganization: Clark University\nLines: 52\n\nIn a previous article, alanchem@csd4.csd.uwm.edu (Alan Scott Olson) wrote:\n>Two-part question:\n> \n>1)  What is Windows NT - a 'real' windows OS?\n> \n>2)  This past weekend, a local 'hacker' radio show metioned a new product\n>    from Microsoft called 'Chicago' if I recall.

It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true \nmulti-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1 \nprograms as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is\nprimarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be\neconomical for most users.\n\tSpeaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.  \nIt iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's \njust to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs, \nand it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed \non CD-ROM.\n\nChicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue \nmultitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements, \nand does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably \nbe more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the \nmain ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.\n\tThe Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense \ncompetition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will \narise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the \nclient machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together, \npartly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).  \n(Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't\nscorn the concept.)\n\tAnyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be \nreleased next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out \ntil '96.\n\tWith luck, I'll be proven wrong! =)\n\nRob\n\n         |------------------------------------------------------------|\n                      \\       rmohns@vax.clarku.edu       /\n               _________\\                               /________\n                          \\         Rob Mohns         /\n               ==================================================\n                    Annoy Rush Limbaugh.

Put\nit at a convenient number like \"1\".  You *could* cut a hole in the\nback of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through the\nhassle?

It shouldn't reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM\nSIMMs, though.\n\n>\tOne last question!

The relevant parts are:\n\n  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate\n  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25\" device mounting bracket]\n\nNote Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to\nmount a 5.25\" device.  The service techs I talked to said, \"Oh sure,\nwe stock those.\"  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to\nhold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already\ncut out for a standard 5.25\" device.  (Why not?  They advertise\nthese machines as being able to accept any standard device in the\n5.25\" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for\ntheir CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.\n\nI'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my\ntape drive, which is a standard 5.25\" device.\n\nGood luck with your SyQuest.\n\n\t-Fred\n\n\n", "From: jaker@csugrad.cs.vt.edu (Jacob Rose)\nSubject: Re: Position of 'b' on Erg.

However, just in case\nsomething went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed\nto get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed\nthat installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when\nyou're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in\nthe section called, \"Windows 3.1 runs slowly\".\n\n\n* MSDOS configuration:\n\n     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your\nCONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,\nyou'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive\n(this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs\nmuch, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section\ncalled, \"Windows 3.1 runs slowly\", for some ways of speeding your system\nup.\n\n\n* Windows configuration:\n\n     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the\n\"[388Enh]\" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:\n\n\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\n\nI believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry\nto SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you\nmight want to try adding some more lines:\n\n\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\n\tSystemROMBreakPoint=false\n\tEMMExclude=A000-CFFF\n\n(You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The\n\"SystemROMBreakPoint\" entry is used to enable support for memory\nmanagers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).\n\n\n* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:\n\n     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that\nyour system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's\nprobably because:\n\n     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your\n\tCONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a\n\twinning solution.\n\n     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to\n\tbe seen ....\n\nIf your system is running much slower than before, this is almost\ndefinitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the\nWindows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808\n(\"SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS\"), you must use\nSmartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really\nslows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a\nfactor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other\nsolutions.\n\n     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you\ndo, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even\ndestroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.\nWhat you can do is one of the following:\n\n     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my\n\topinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused\n\teither by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in\n\tSmartdrive.\n\n     2. Use a driver that provides \"VDS\" services (\"VDS\" stands for\n\t\"Virtual DMA Services\").  This is a standard, which is supported\n\tby Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like\n\tthe 1542) to work with Windows.\n\n     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following\nsolutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I\nam now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused\nby these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following\ndoes not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is\nstrongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:\n\n1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI\n   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two\n   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your\n   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n\n\tDRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n\n   (Windows needs the \"/V386\" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into\n   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies\n   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be\n   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's\n   still there).\n\n2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version\n   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers\n   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n\n\tDRIVER=c:\\ASPI4DOS.SYS\n\tDRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n\n   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high\n   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would\n   crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support\n   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine\n   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.\n\n   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would\n   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting\n   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my\n   C:\\WINDOWS\\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes\n   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE\n   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason\n   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.\n\n   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of\n   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.\n\n   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without\n   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider\n   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.\n\n3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is\n   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer\n   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS\n   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not\n   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only\n   three ways to get a copy:\n\n      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver\n\tkit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other\n\tdrivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is\n\taround $75.\n\n      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you\n\tcan supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for\n\taround $30.\n\n      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0\n\tfor MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in\n\tdifferent directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is\n\tincluded; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two\n\thard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy\n\tof ASPI4DOS 3.1.\n\nNote, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with\nWindows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing\nthis, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above\nsolutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk\naccesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the\nparity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off\ntiming for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various\nmemory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no\nproblems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal\ntiming requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers\n(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems\nshow up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case\nit isn't a hardware problem.\n\n\n***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:\n\n     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a\nfloppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory\nSystems Jumbo 250:\n\n1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive\n   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.\n\n2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.\n   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.\n   However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so\n   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my\n   1542.)\n\n\n* Tape backups/restores take a long time:\n\n     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may\nhave to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 \"bus on/off timing\" for best\nresults when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup\nor restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with\nonly an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the\nAdaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,\nstart and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the\ntape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective\ntape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).\nThis also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer\nthan necessary.\n\n     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to\ntransfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA\nto transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs\nto feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is\nnot fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,\nrewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).\nThe default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is\n\"too large\".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be\ntransferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the\ntape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec \"hogs\" the memory too\nmuch (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to\nmemory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the\ntape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,\nbecause data is not fed to it quickly enough.\n\n     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The\ndefault factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.\nThe \"bus on\" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can\nbe done in one of two ways:\n\n* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the \"/n\" option.  For example, I use\n  a \"bus on\" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the\n  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n\tDEVICE=c:\\aspi4dos.sys /n4\n\n  Note that there is NO space between the \"/n\" and the \"4\".\n\n* If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a\n  program called \"SETSCSI.EXE\", which is very difficult to find.  The\n  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to\n  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for\n  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have\n  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to\n  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have\n  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:\n\n\tsetscsi -n:4\n\n  This adjusts the \"bus on\" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running\n  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the\n  factory defaults.\n\n  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use\n  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I\n  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.\n\nDo not lower the \"bus on\" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it\nabove 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk\nthroughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4\nmicroseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may\nhave to adjust it downwards a little.\n\n     Once you've lowered the \"bus on\" timing, tape backups and restores\nshould run faster.\n\n     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other\noptions that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what\nyou are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by\nstarving memory refresh.\n\n     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless\nthis has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),\nthis is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple\nof other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the\nbus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried\nrunning this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I\nwas running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a\nconflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,\nalthough the docs say that it works with the 1542A?\n\n\n* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:\n\n     This \"problem\" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my\nsystem, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.\nHowever, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm\nmentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my\n1542.\n\n     Symptoms of this \"problem\", which persists even after cleaning the\ntape head:\n\n1. Backing up to tape encounters \"unusable sector detected\" errors,\n   resulting in an aborted tape backup.\n\n2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.\n\n3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.\n   Unlike the above-mentioned problem (\"Tape backups/restores take a\n   long time\"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,\n   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.\n\n4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other\n   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software\n   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the\n   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.\n\n5. Too many tape read errors.\n\n     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered\nthat using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I\nupgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy\ncontroller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I\ninitially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I\ndecided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on\nthe motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)\nreliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly\nable to find and use the tape drive.\n\n     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.\nOn the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached\nto the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the\n1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to\nthe 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different\ncontroller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my\n1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that\nthe problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is;\nhowever, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider\ntrying a new floppy controller.\n\n\n***** Sound cards:\n\n     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and\nthis is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the\nAdaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the\ntape DMA, this \"conflict\" usually manifests itself as a parity error\n(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is\nthat, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the\nAdaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a\nparity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a\nhardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity\nerror is not a symptom of bad hardware.\n\n     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording\ndigitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase\nthe recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,\nrecording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).\n\n     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the\nAdaptec's \"bus on\" timing.  See the section on tape drives for\ninformation on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may\nnot solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity\nerror.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect\nthis problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the\nspeed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also\naffect this.\n\n\n***** Miscellaneous info:\n\n     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much\nof it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not\nverified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm\nnot sure.  Use it at your own risk.\n\n* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the \"DB=\"\n  parameter (e.g., \"DB=2\"), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.\n  If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM\n  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that\n  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM\n  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install\n  program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of\n  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a\n  version earlier than 6.00).\n\n  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the \"DB=\" parameter.\n\n* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one\n  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you\n  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is\n  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.\n\n* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and\n  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces\n  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three\n  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following\n  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand\n  information):\n\n     1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for\n\tsomething like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,\n\tyou can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact\n\tAdaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains\n\teverything that you need.\n\n     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the\n\tsame people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM\n\tdrivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know\n\tthe list price, but I've seen this package sold for around\n\t$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS\n\tdriver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,\n\tyou may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.\n\n     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been\n\tobsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in\n\tcase someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the\n\tdrivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410\n\tkit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of\n\tMSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in\n\tthe ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin\n\tboards.\n\n* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows\n  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are\n  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how\n  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the\n  following is secondhand information):\n\n     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large\n\tnumber of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers\n\t(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.\n\n     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup\n\tprogram (see the above section on CDROM drives for more\n\tdetails).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but\n\trequires, ASPI4DOS.\n\n* I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:\n\n     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.\n     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.\n     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and\n\tCorelSCSI! drivers/programs.\n\n  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:\n\n     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI\n\tdrivers).\n\n* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar\n  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you\n  need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used\n  this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know\n  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,\n  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:\n\n\tPD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL>\n\tASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx\n\tASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10\n\tASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr\n\n  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might\n  have it, if any forum does.\n\n* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are\n  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.\n  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and\n  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work\n  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of\n  BSD Unix).\n\n* In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS\n  3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\scsiha.sys /V386\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked\n  like:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\scsiha.sys /V386\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I\n  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still\n  need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first\n  two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version\n  doesn't.\n\n\n\f\nLocal Variables:\nfill-column:\t72\neval:\t\t(auto-fill-mode nil)\nEnd:\n", "From: rajiev@cfmu.eurocontrol.be (Rajiev Gupta)\nSubject: Re: Questions about Windows NT.

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\n\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\n      4x4s can run the course.\n     \n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\n\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\n  of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper\n  from their vehicle :) .\n\nThe Particulars:\n\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\n* A valid drivers license is required\n* Suggested equipment:\n      CB Radio\n      Compass\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\n      Clip Board and Pencil\n* No alcohol during rally\n* For more information contact\n   Gary (815)727-3415\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\n   Brian (708)979-6083\n\n\n                                            __\n              Instant                      /\\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\n------|---------------------------------------------\n Exit |              |             |         ^\n 257  |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\n      |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |       Rt80                 |         v\n----------------------------------------------------\n      |                            | Exit\n      |                            | 130B\n      |                            |\n   \n", "From: nlu@Xenon.Stanford.EDU (Nelson Lu)\nSubject: SHARKS REVIEW Part 3: Defensemen (21-45)\nOrganization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University.\nLines: 85\n\n#21\tPETER AHOLA\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nIt is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the\nPenguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had\nonly played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose\nMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he\nhas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been\nspectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points);\nit's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn\nout to be ... Peter Ahola.\n\n#24\tDOUG WILSON\t\tSeason: 16th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and\n\t\t2nd round pick in '92 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nI have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high\nexpectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.\nNevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and\nplaymaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,\nunfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to\ncatch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for\n2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be\nWilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.\n\n#29\tDEAN KOLSTAD\t\tSeason:\t2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (C-/D+)\n\nIt's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of\ngames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's\nquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\n\n#38\tPAT MACLEOD\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\nhe wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\na \"rehab assignment\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\nSince he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\nskills.\n\n#41\tTOM PEDERSON\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+)\n\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\n43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\n\n#45\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+/D)\n\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that\nwill go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he\nwas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that\nthe >=15\" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over\ndistances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore\n*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*\n(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN\nInformation Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and\nprobably only way of having any chance of receiving a \"perfect\" monitor\n(the definition of \"perfect\" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my\ncase quite :).\n\n>Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?\n\nI, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard\nmonitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,\nfinally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,\nbut a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying\nconvince me was \"normal\"). The short answer is no, don't accept these\n\"imperfections\" as \"normal\" because for the premium one pays for the\nlarger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and\nif you're persistent, you'll receive it.\n\n>...............................................................\n>:      Comments and opinions are mine - not BNR's             :\n>: Doug Adcock                      adcock@bnr.ca              :\n>: Bell-Northern Research           Research Triangle Park, NC :\n>...............................................................\n\n\nRegards,\nPaul Yee\nyee@nimios.eng.mcmaster.ca\n", "From: jhwhit01@ulkyvx.louisville.edu\nSubject: Re: What's a good IC for RS232 -> TTL signals??\nLines: 18\nNntp-Posting-Host: ulkyvx.louisville.edu\nOrganization: University of Louisville\n\nIn article <C5nz60.99z@scraps.uucp>, frankh@scraps.uucp (Frank Holden KA3UWW) writes:\n> In <C57zsC.9FL@news.cso.uiuc.edu> rky57514@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Tall Cool One ) writes:\n> \n>>I'm looking for an IC that will convert RS232 voltage levels to TTL voltage \n>>levels.

The\nnice thing about this player is that you can also watch\nnormal Laserdisc movies on it as well.  I have one which I\nwill sell for $600 by itself, $550 with a purchase of one\ncomplete system or $500 if you buy both systems.\n \n    I currently run this into my entertainment center.  I have\nit housed in a PC computer case with with its own fan, and \npower supply.  I run the audio into my stereo system, and the\nlaserdisc runs directly into the T.V..  I have made a mount for\nthe joysticks and the buttons.  First person who buys both\ngames will get it all, otherwise you have to do it yourself.\n \n    If you would prefer to have it all housed in a normal\narcade cabinet this can be done as well.  The graphics will\ngo nicely along the sides and front of the cabinet.\n \n    Everything works perfectly.  The laserdisc player has an\nRS-232 port which you can use to develop your own multimedia\ntype applications.  The Laserdiscs have been stored in a safe\nplace and have no scratches on them.\n \n    If you are interested please email me.\n \n    Thanks,\n \n     Soren\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------\nSoren Burkhart\nPurdue University        \"Yes, well that is just the sort of\nA.I. & Robotics\t\t  blink-headed pig ignorance I have\nzoron@en.ecn.purdue.edu   come to expect from you non-creative\n\t\t\t  garbage.\"\n \n                              John Cleese (Monty Python)\n", "From: adam@endor.uucp (Adam Shostack)\nSubject: Re: Israeli Terrorism\nArticle-I.D.: das.1993Apr26.184547.20058\nOrganization: Aiken Computation Lab, Harvard University\nLines: 65\n\nIn article <2BDAD779.24910@news.service.uci.edu> tclock@orion.oac.uci.edu (Tim Clock) writes:\n>In article <AMOSS.93Apr25163327@shuldig.cs.huji.ac.il> amoss@shuldig.cs.huji.ac.il (Amos Shapira) writes:\n>>cy779@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Anas Omran) writes:\n\n>>Eh????

They\ninclude the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, the\nfact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and the\nhistorical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.\n\n\tWhen Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948,\nthe cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit\nreligious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan,\nwho did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  The\nJordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned a\nJewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in their\nlatrines.\n\n\tIsrael has allowed individuals of all religions into\nJerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness to\ncontrol the city.\n\n\tAlso, I should point out that Islam is not centered in\nJerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca,\nwhere all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).

Using these files represents hacking\n   in a very true sense, so practice safe computing and don't play\n   around too much if you don't like the risks and aren't knowledgable\n   about what you're doing.\n4) If you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings, use the DMQS files\n   you have or wait until IBM releases official, tested DMQS files.\n   Although you should be aware of warning 2) even with the IBM files.\n\nTHESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!

If you don't want to hear\nthe transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator\nis the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch,\nTHEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.\n\n\tIt used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors\nin switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few\nthousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which\ndrives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  And, the devices\nare cheaper than relays.\n\n\tJohn Whitmore\n", "From: eugenehs@phakt.usc.edu (HEUGE aka Eugene Hsu)\nSubject: Re: pc-X\nOrganization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA\nLines: 25\nDistribution: usa\nNNTP-Posting-Host: phakt.usc.edu\n\nIn article <4552@isgtec.isgtec.com> ted@isgtec.com (Ted Richards) writes:\n>Al DeVilbiss (al@col.hp.com) wrote:\n>:\n>: I just brought up NCD's PC-XView, Windows version, to use over a \n>: modem link to a Unix system at HP.

And enlightening.\n\nHere's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,\ncirca June 1986.\n\n1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\n    not gain more bulk.\n\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.\n\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\n    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\n    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\n\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\n\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\nso that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.\n\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\nthe bathead more freely.\n\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\n\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\nthe park.\n\nIf Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\nproblems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\nstill hit 600+ HR.\n\n\n-- \n*   Gary Huckabay   * \"You think that's loud enough, a$$hole?\"           *\n*   \"Movie Rights   * \"Well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir,   *\n*   available thru  *  I'd be happy to turn it up for you.

In other words, you can only be sure\nthat your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll\ngrant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.\n\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\ncertain.

Saying you are absolutely certain is\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.

When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\nfallible.

The hardware will\nautomagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high\nIRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now. \n   I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1\non IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of\nthe interrupts in between. Works just great.\n   If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that\ndetails how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the\nhigher IRQs.

Back\nthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.\nAfter all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of \nthousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and \nmillions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and \nother people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.

It is evident that the West, especially America,\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\nresponsible for his decision to invade.

Or to allow them to continue with mass\nslaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I'd have to\nsay yes, stopping Hussein was the most \"loving\" thing to do for the\nmost people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.\n> \n>> So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?

It is precisely the lessons the world learned\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take\nAustria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting\nHussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to\nprotect Saudi Arabia.\n\n> \n>>                                                           I guess we\n>> shouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\n>> German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.\n> \n> Yes, do.

But then\nI learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict\non a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably\nwould have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated\nassault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which\nnews commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California\nlaw.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it's evident that \nthe first jury decided that the officers were \"not guilty\".  Note, \nnot \"not guilty\" of doing wrong, but \"not guilty\" of aggravated assault \nwith the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the \nprosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a \nverdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.\n\nIf the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then\nI feel the \"not guilty\" verdict was a reasonable one.\n\n> \n> mathew\n> [ \"Thou shalt not kill... unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing,\n>    in which case thou shalt kill, and also kill anyone who gets in the way,\n>    as unfortunately it cannot be helped.\"\n>                                    -- Jim Brown Bible for Loving Christians ]\n\nThanks mathew, I like the quote.

His 1988 figure was slightly below average.\nHis 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of\nthat may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the\nPadres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and\njudging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play\nthird.\n\n>Williams, Matt       ----  ----  .633  .653  .656   0.647\nAdd another to the elite fielders list.\n\n>Caminiti, Ken        ----  .675  .630  .653  .596   0.642\n>Sabo, Chris          .751  .626  .616  .613  .575   0.642\nToo fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know\nwhat happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low\n1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988\n(best year ever) brings his average up a lot.\n\n>Buechele, Steve      .647  .616  .647  .681  .599   0.635\nStrange last two years.\n\n>Schmidt, Mike        .628  ----  ----  ----  ----   0.628\nAccording to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base.\nBut at the end, he was below average.

I'm not sure why Jefferies\ngets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while\nat second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder\nat third.\n\n>Zeile, Todd          ----  ----  ----  .614  .593   0.605\nZeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about\n10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry\nPendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.\n\n>Baerga, Carlos       ----  ----  ----  .604  ----   0.604\nMoving back to second was a good idea.\n\n>Hayes, Chris         ----  .601  .622  .606  .574   0.602\nSo why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total\nof one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.\n\n>Johnson, Howard      .628  .549  .611  .573  ----   0.588\n>Lansford, Carney     .620  .578  .594  ----  .550   0.587\nHoward Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit,\nHoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break\nthe .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.\n\n>Hollins, Dave        ----  ----  ----  ----  .577   0.577\nGood hitter, but his fielding needs work.\n\n>Sheffield, Gary      ----  ----  .584  ----  .567   0.575\nNot a good fielder.\n\n>Blauser, Jeff        ----  .573  ----  ----  ----   0.573\n>Fryman, Travis       ----  ----  ----  .571  ----   0.571\nBoth are better off at shortstop.\n\n>Gomez, Lee           ----  ----  ----  .551  .542   0.546\nTwo consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to\nhave helped his fielding any.  \n\n>Palmer, Dean         ----  ----  ----  ----  .520   0.520\nTexas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest\nDA at third ever.

Ask yourself this.  Why would any private\nsector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least\npartially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any\nprivate sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly\nevaluated?

The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know\nlittle about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step\nin the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning\nor SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the \"Clipper\" system is easily\njustified \"Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying\nto subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative\nso use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.\"\nHow can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing\nlaw enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system\nthe only crypto available in the U.S... ?

I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.\n \nIt is apparent to me that those who drafted the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \"Big Brother Proposal\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep\n\n\n\n\n\nends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \"experts\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.\n \nIn addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \"tamper proof\" the key escrows might be.\n \nI cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti\n\n\n\n\n\nlize the \"Big Brother Chip.\"\n \nUnfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \"harmony,\" \"right to encryption,\" and \"voluntary.\"\n \nIt mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \"I can't believe it's happening here.\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\"\n \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost Concerned,\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t[Signature]\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShaen Logan Bernhardt I\nuni@acs.bu.edu\n\n-- \nuni@acs.bu.edu  ->  Public Keys by finger and/or request\nPublic Key Archives at <pgp-public-keys@junkbox.cc.iastate.edu>\nDF610670F2467B99  97DE2B5C3749148C  Sovereignty is the sign of a brutal past.\nCryptography is not a crime.

Hmm.  That'll be rather difficult!\n\nThe more standard (read: better) method is to use ultrasound, generally\nsomewhere around 40kHz.  Sound travels a heck of a lot slower than light\n(radio waves), and is therefore much easier to deal with.\n\n>What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?\n\nIt might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerous\n\"sonic estimator\" type devices that do what you want here.  Many are pretty \ncheap too -- <$30.  (In fact, for awhile the Stanley Estimator was selling\nfor something like $8.  That's the one I bought! :-) )\n\n\t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad\n", "From: rnichols@cbnewsg.cb.att.com (robert.k.nichols)\nSubject: Re: TrueType fonts that display but do not print.\nSummary: Adjust OutlineThreshold\nOrganization: AT&T\nDistribution: na\nLines: 30\n\nIn article <1993Apr17.134725.15882@mintaka.lcs.mit.edu> avinash@silver.lcs.mit.edu (Avinash Chopde) writes:\n>I just installed a new TrueType font under MS-Windows 3.1\n>but though all the applications display the font correctly on the\n>screen, quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly\n>(on a LaserJet 4 - non-PostScript printer).\n...\n>But when I use the Windows accessory Write, the printer prints square\n>boxes in place of the characters of the new font.

Microsoft\nadmits to a problem with older versions of the PostScript printer driver,\nbut I've found it to be pretty generic.\n\nYou can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter OutlineThreshold\nin the [TrueType] section of WIN.INI.  This entry specifies the number of\npels-per-em at which Windows will render TrueType fonts as outline fonts\ninstead of as bitmap fonts.  The default is 256.  I've generally been able\nto get fonts to work by setting OutlineThreshold=160.  Depending on your\nprinter resolution and the point size you are using, you may need a\ndifferent value.\n\nThe Windows Resource Kit warns against going above 300.  Presumably, that\nmight cause fonts to print as square boxes or something.  :-|  (I'm not\nsmiling.)\n\n--\nBob Nichols\nAT&T Bell Laboratories\nrnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com\n", "From: u083s121@astro.ocis.temple.edu (cis083 sec001 spr93)\nSubject: Leading Edge Computer-Buy?\nOrganization: Temple University\nLines: 46\nNntp-Posting-Host: astro.ocis.temple.edu\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\n\n\n  I saw the following computer in a store and wanted to know if this is a good\ncomputer or does someone see something wrong with it.

Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking\nanything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea\nof taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,\nadditional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are\nnot known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that\nin a given situation the risk is worthwhile.\n   Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in\nsome cases where the tri-cyclics fail.

Is it transmitted periodically\nin the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the\nphone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever,\nor tries it to turn them into voice-output ?

Most\npeople suspect that they cannot trust their senses, but few take\nthe next step to figure out that they can trust themselves.

Protestants emphasize conversion,\nexperience of the Holy Spirit, and use of the Bible.  This is intended\nto make sure that Christians have religious experience of their own,\nand that they have some basis on which to judge claims of clergy and\nother Christians.  I can't speak for Catholics and Orthodox, but I\nbelieve they also attempt to avoid having members who simply repeat\nwhat they are told.  I admit that this isn't always successful -- we\ncertainly see young people join our church because at that age parents\nexpect it.  But most of our members do seem quite able and willing to\nmake judgements for themselves, and have a commitment that comes out\nof their own experience.  Unfortunately, it's the nature of Usenet\nthat doctrinal disagreements get emphasized, so it looks like we spend\nmost of our time dealing with doctrine.  That's certainly not my\nexperience of the way Christians really live.  --clh]\n", "From: cookson@mbunix.mitre.org (Cookson)\nSubject: DOT Tire date codes\nNntp-Posting-Host: mbunix.mitre.org\nOrganization: The MITRE Corp., Bedford, Ma.\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 25\n\nI just mailed this:\n\nI noticed a 2-3in long cut in the tread of the rear tire on my VFR.\nThe cut is only about as deep as the tread block, and looks like it\nonly scratched the rubber at the base, but the weird thing is, it's\nway over on the edge where I haven't scuffed the tire in yet.\nMy questions are:\n1.

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\nrocket ship.\n\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\nmid-June.\n\n        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\nmillion for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\nagencies.\n\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\nchanges in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\n\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\nsaid Col.  Simon \"Pete\" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\nprogram. \"I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\nhave available to spend,\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\n\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \"better,\nfaster, cheaper\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \"leapfrog\" ahead of\nevolutionary technology developments.\n\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \"build a little, test a\nlittle\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\nshowed how today's engineers could move beyond the \"miracles of our\nparents' time.\"\n\n        \"The key is management,\" Worden said. \"SDIO had a very light hand\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\"\n\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\ncrucial. \"It's essential we do not end up with a large management\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially.\"\n\n        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. \"This is the direction\nwe're going to have to go,\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's\nDemocratic chairman. \"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't\nsustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.\"\n\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.\nJoking that \"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\"\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\nwere left to the civil space agency.\n\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \"Let's not\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!\"\n\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\n\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\nabout a large private secotro commitment. \"On very large ventures,\ncompanies put in seed money,\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'\nsenior vice president for space systems. \"You need strong government\ninvestments.\"\n\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\nAircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\n\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \"expand the envelope\"\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\nfeet.\n\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\ntests will include a \"pitch-over\" manever that rotates the vehicle back\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\n\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \"Pete\"\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\n\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\nthrust\n\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\nturnaround.\n\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\n\n        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has\na technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible\nfor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.\n\n\n", "From: elliott@optilink.COM (Paul Elliott)\nSubject: Re: Analog switches/Balanced Demodulators\nDistribution: na\nOrganization: DSC/Optilink Access Products\nLines: 53\n\nIn article <msf.734832494@skaro> msf@skaro.as.arizona.edu (Michael Fulbright) writes:\n>I am trying to build a synchronous demodulator and I've hit a snag.\n>In my application I want to be able to change the gain of an\n>op amp amplifier from 1 to -1, controlable via a digital input.\n>The most obvious way I've come up with is to use analog switches\n>to adjust the gain of the op amp.

In short, I am happy\nwith the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time\nfutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor\nis pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17\" Magnavox went away.  It\nisn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the\nmonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.\n\nIn going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors\nin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program\nwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,\nOrchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those\nare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses\na Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite\ncard does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as\nI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to\nprint the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3\ncards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.\n\nThe supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if\nyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors\nlisted plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high\nrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me\nthat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz\nat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution\nwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,\nand it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.\n\nThe higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone\nwith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable\nto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as\nhe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have\nthe problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.\n\nThe board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\nSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results\nin pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they\nwere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz\n386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers\nwere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with\n8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it\ncomputes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.\n\n\nK means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second\n\n             Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000\nChip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000\nDIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K\nMemory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M\nScreen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M\nVector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M\nVector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K\nPolygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M\nPolygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M\nTernary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K\nFont                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M\n\nThe DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers\nit to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as\nconversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to\nthe screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can\njust be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that\nface from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid\nvectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,\nfilled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics\noperations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two\nnumbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.\nWhen the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --\n1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds\nlike programming to a benchmark to me....\n\nI make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what\nI saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,\nbut this time maybe I'd better.

This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \"verbatim \ntranslation\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --\nthe book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section\nby section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.\nIn the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce \nthe German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not \nsurprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a \nsingle idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi\nlaw; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, \nurban-folklore style.\n\n2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a \ncopy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution \nteam or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't \nunderstand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable \nto imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and \nyet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:\n\n\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons\nLaw during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of\ndocuments, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German\nlaw registry].\"\n\nBingo.  Exactly.  \n\nDodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one\nunder discussion.  All of the stuff about \"Why would a U.S. congressman\nhave a copy of a Nazi law?\" melts away, by the author's admission.  He\nthen continues:  \"But if he acquired the original German text of the \nNazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so \nfor a very specific reason...\"  But there's absolutely no reason to \nthink that this is the case.  In fact, as a \"senior member of the U.S. \nteam that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\", it seems to me that\nhe would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether \nthe Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously\nis, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally\nprosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red \nherrings.\n\n3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the\nJPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he \nasked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge \nlevelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask \nto have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd \ntook it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing \nit into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, \nwouldn't he?\n    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier\nposting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this\npurpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent\non disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil\nliberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it\non their own?\n    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his\nown question: \"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law\nto show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the \nNazi law.\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered\ninto the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \"concerning\nthe history of Nazism and gun confiscation\", Dodd's motivation isn't a \nmystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.\n\n4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that\nwas added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  \nRegistration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT\na \"Nazi-inspired\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the \n1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification \nof certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list \nother parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;\nof course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,\nin a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the \ndiscussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, \n\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68...\" -- so \nas to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.\n-- \n\t\t\t\t\t-- Don Porges\n\t\t\t\t\tporges@inmet.camb.inmet.com\n\t\t\t\t\t..uunet!inmet!porges\n", "From: johnr@col.hp.com (John T.

Bussard, Journal of\n\tPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990\n\n\t    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion\n\t    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the\n\t    thrust-power \"gain\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values\n\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\n\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \"high-thrust\"\n\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\n\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\n\t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\n\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\n\t    \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a\n\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\n\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows\n\t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in\n\t    Earth/moon space.\n\n\t\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for\n\tAerospace Flight Propulsion\" by Robert W.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\n\tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\n\n\t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\n\t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\n\t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\n\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\n\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\n\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\n\t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm\n\t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure\n\t    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically\n\t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power\n\t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens\n\t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the\n\t    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages\n\t    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I\n\t    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob\n\t    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently\n\t    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one\n\t    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather\n\t    than Tokamak.

First, it points to the\nnecessity of doing a study, and second, it at least says that the effects are\nall psychological (or possibly allergy in this case).

On the other hand, it could just be an allergy to the food it's in,   or something.

Currently I have  \n8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  \nboth banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  \nof running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  \nthat more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  \ncan see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  \n$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  \nthe entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  \nthe machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  \navoid...\n\nSo my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  \nwell with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  \n$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  \ndo they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  \nextra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  \nISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  \nprobably all of this is just wishful thinking...

I bought it in California, and if\nit'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these\nIndiana winters--my heater controls don't work.\n\nThe car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is\nstuck in the \"vent\" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air\nflow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't \nlive without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the \ndefrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well,\nkind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.\n\nI have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think\nthe problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down\nand outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in-\nside(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is\nprobably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n\t1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than\n\tthe fact that I should move from Indiana) ?\n\n\t2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there\n\ta way to \"fix\" this?\n\nTHanks for any advice/info\n\nselah,\n\nDan\nlovall@physics.purdue.edu\n", "From: meyers@leonardo.rtp.dg.com (Bill Meyers)\nSubject: Re: The 'pill' for Deer = No Hunting\nOrganization: N/I\nLines: 114\n\nIn article <1qk3jm$9sh@transfer.stratus.com> cdt@sw.stratus.com (C.

Neil Smith\n\n                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE\n\n[AUTHOR'S NOTE:  \"Adrian\" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- \nand the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with \nthe same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]\n\nDear Adrian:  \n\nI'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to \nyour note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and \ngenerally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist \nmostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back \nwith evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present \nnow.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the \nfuture.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  \n\nThere are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger \nof delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. \n10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, \nshifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic \nrifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll \nlimit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent \nwith your note.  \n\nFirst, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nSecond, publication of some latter-day \"scientific study\" doesn't \nalter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my \ninterview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  \n\nThird, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nFourth, as often happens with these things, the \"study\" doesn't \nsupport the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions \nanyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older \nbody of lies, omissions, and distortions.  \n\nFifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nSixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on \ncountless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND \nBEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this \npresent \"study\" dubious, to say the least.  \n\nSeventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nEighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat \n(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you \nshould be better aware than most people how \"progress\" -- in \ndesigning \"studies\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our \nability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree \non is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 \nyears to create \"studies\" \"proving\" that pornography causes crime.  \nMore naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s \nclearly indicate the contrary.  \n\nNinth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nTenth, another reason to doubt all such \"studies\" is that human \nbehavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far\ntoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The \nattempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the \nresulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  \n\nEleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nTwelfth, the \"study\" is also worthless because it incorporates \nfigures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but \nbasically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social \nbenefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a \ncriminal offense.  \n\nThirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials \nquoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are \nmany), are correct in this instance:  the \"study\" is meaningless \nbecause the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nAnd because of that, Adrian, even if the \"study\" were valid, it \nwouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that \nanyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, \nwhenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's \npermission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists \nthemselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed \npeople to go out and buy their first gun \"while they still can\".  \nBefore the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \"shooting fraternity\" \nviewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, \nineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in \nthe whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, \nand their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we \nprobably manufacture at least that many every year.\n\nThe fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly \naware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what \ntheir real motives are.  \n\nLook:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, \nit's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; \nthe fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the \nself-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing \nthis further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a \nquarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \"half life\" \nof 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna \nbe around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.\n\nAs for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law \nprovides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I \nwill always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is \nthat there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands \n-- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can \nonly be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given \nboth the practical and alleged differences between full automatics \nand semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  \n\nSo what's the point?  \n\nL.

The general setup is designed so that when users \n\tconnect they send a private key encrypted using the system public\n\tkey and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the\n\tone-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The\n\tresult of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it\n\tis impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the\n\tmachine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed\n\tsystem private key to entice users into revealing thier personal\n\tprivate keys during the authentication sequence.\n\nQuestions:\n\n\tDoes the fact that the system private key does not provide any\n\tinformation useful for a search give me any protection as far as\n\tbeing coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)\n\n\tIt seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am\n\tassisting in \"entrapment\" (the users would send thier key anyway\n\tand are not being enticed into doing something they would not\n\totherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?\n\n\tWould the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?\n\nAny answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...\n\njim\n-- \nJim McCoy                |  UT Unix Sysadmin Tiger Team\nmccoy@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu |  #include <disclaimer.h>\nj-mccoy@nwu.edu          |  pgp key available via finger or upon request\n", "From: reza@magellan.ae.utexas.edu (Alireza Vali)\nSubject: Do the 2MB ATI Ultra Pro 16 and 24 bit Windows Drivers Work?\nOrganization: University of Texas at Austin\nLines: 35\n\nHi there.

Questions to Israelis\n\n\nTo:  shaig@Think.COM\n\nSubject: Ten questions to Israelis\n\nDear Shai,\n\nYour answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.\n\nIn the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of\nIsraeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have\nreceived from other quarters, according to which there are two\ndistinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship\n(Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports\netc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I\nam told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all\ntimes and present them at many public places, almost every day.\nThese ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.\nYou maintain that this mainly because of religious services\nprovided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\nCould you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\nserves no other purpose ?\n\nIn the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\nIsrael has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were\n'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I\nread, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\nplans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\nTransjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of\nBen-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was\nestablished, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for\nlater expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the\nfact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\nland to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God\npromised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the\nborders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use\ntoday ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what\nit considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a\nbase for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one\ncannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\nnumber of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\n\nYour answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\nofficial. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\nVanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without\nevaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\nthe truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\nshould he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\n\nSomebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning\n'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from\nMa'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do\nexist in Israel. What do you think about that ?\n\nYou imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a\nway to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been\nused by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet\nUnion into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they\nwould not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are\nclearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be\nvery happy if you could convince me that what I am told about\nIsrael were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so.\nI suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest\ndiscussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\n\nI hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth.\n\n", "From: mary@uicsl.csl.uiuc.edu (Mary E.

All I can say is that I will not consume it.  \n\n[...]\n\n   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION\n   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\n\n   [Reproduced without permission]\n\n\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\n\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\n\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\n\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\n\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\n\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\n\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\n\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\n\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\n\tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\n\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\n\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\n\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\n\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\n\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\n\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\n\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\n\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\n\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\n\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\n\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\n\n\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\n\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\n\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\n\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\n\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\n\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\n\tafter the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm\n\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the\n\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\n\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association's\n\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\n\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\n\tclean bill of health.\n\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\n\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\n\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\n\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\n\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\n\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\n\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\n\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\n\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\n\tof selected foods omitted]\n\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\n\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\n\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\n\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\n\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\n\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\n\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\n\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\n\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\n\tContains Phenylalanine.\"\n\n\n-Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)\n\n", "From: rcomg@melomys.co.rmit.oz.AU (Mark Gregory)\nSubject: AVI file format?\nSummary: AVI file format?\nKeywords: AVI file format?\nOrganization: Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology\nLines: 21\nNNTP-Posting-Host: melomys.cse.rmit.edu.au\n\n\nHi,\n\twould someone please email (and post)\nthe AVI (Microsoft) file format.

The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?\n* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\n* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\n* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\n* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\n* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\n  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\n* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\n  relatively easy to break?\n\n\n* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?\n\n  The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted\n  acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A\n  by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone\n  who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.\n\n  A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so\n  that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is\n  the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art\n  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when\n  you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both\n  cryptography and cryptanalysis.\n\n  The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is\n  called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert\n  plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert\n  ciphertext into plaintext.\n\n  A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The\n  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,\n  Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different\n  values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.\n\n  The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are\n  called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,\n  eavesdroppers, or third parties.\n\n* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\n\n  For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given\n  in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,\n  concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,\n  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has\n  developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and\n  mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is\n  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up\n  to the mid-60's.\n\n  Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or\n  Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want\n  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common\n  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.\n\n  The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of\n  many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently\n  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The\n  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range\n  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,\n  access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments\n  apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].\n\n  The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite\n  technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in\n  the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of\n  DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses\n  of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on\n  modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management\n  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and\n  networks.\n\n  The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on\n  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.\n\n* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\n\n  Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of\n  analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern\n  finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available\n  textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series\n  [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for\n  the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given\n  systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the\n  cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still\n  classified.\n\n  Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,\n  or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare\n  of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the\n  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.\n\n* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\n\n  In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can\n  find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.\n\n  Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding\n  ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the\n  plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or\n  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.\n  Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this\n  brute-force search is impractical.\n    \n  Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered\n  practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years\n  now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with\n  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the\n  mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic\n  decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel\n  machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.\n  Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].\n\n  One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a\n  brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.\n\n* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\n\n  The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key\n  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.\n\n  A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The\n  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of\n  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and\n  if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount\n  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is\n  probably strong.\n\n  A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears\n  random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).\n    \n  A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A\n  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.\n\n  If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily\n  strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.\n  However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is\n  strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then\n  he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring\n  integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.\n\n* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\n  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\n\n  Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical\n  cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your\n  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might\n  assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is\n  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the\n  rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same\n  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus\n  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he\n  doesn't have a chance.\n\n  Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,\n  for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even\n  chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into\n  the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See\n  [KAH67].\n  \n* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\n  relatively easy to break?\n\n  Some don't know any better. Often amateurs think they can design\n  secure systems, and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst\n  could do. And sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody\n  to invest the work needed to crack a system.\n", "From: steve-b@access.digex.com (Steve Brinich)\nSubject: Re: Once tapped, your code is no good any more.\nOrganization: Express Access Online Communications, Greenbelt, MD USA\nLines: 5\nDistribution: na\nNNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net\n\n  Agreed.

Of cause, the R4-version\n\tdid not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass \t\t\tinstead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition \t\t\t(formerly XtTblPosition).\n\tSince compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error\n\t(on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the\n\tmodel_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText \n\twidgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of \t\t\tzero. \n\tThus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the \t\t\twidth and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup \t\tor XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on \t\t\twhether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource \t\t\tfile or not).\n\t\n\tQuestion: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered\n\t\t\tvalues when working on table widgets or perhaps what\n\t\t\tto do about?\n\n\tI'll be happy, if someone is able to help me. \n\tGermans are requested to answer in german.\n\t\n\tSiegfried Kaiser\n\temail: kaiser@uniko.uni-koblenz.de\n\n\t\n\tThe part of interest:\n\n\n\t/* Graphischer Neuaufbau des Model-Init-Formulars */\n\t\t/* Storing the old width and height of the viewport-\t*/\n\t\t/* widget, which is the parent of the troubling table\t*/\n\t\t/* widget, before the viewport widget is destroyed\t*/\n\t\t/* The destroying of widgets before resizing them is a\t*/\n\t\t/* relict from R3-age\t\t\t\t\t*/\n\t\n\tif (model_init_popped_up) \n\t\tXtUnmapWidget(model_init_form_view);\n\tXtDestroyWidget(model_init_form_view);\n\t\n\t\t/* Creating the subtree within the shell, of which the\t*/\n\t\t/* root is the viewport widget\t\t\t\t*/\n\t\n\tn = 0;\n\tXtSetArg(args[n],XtNfromVert,model_init_title); n++;\n\tXtSetArg(args[n],XtNfromHoriz,model_init_button_view); n++;\n\tXtSetArg(args[n],XtNallowVert,True); n++;\n\tXtSetArg(args[n],XtNforceBars,True); n++;\n\tmodel_init_form_view = XtCreateWidget(\"form_view\",viewportWidgetClass,\n\t\t\t\t\t      model_init_form,args,n);\n\n\tn = 0;\n\tmodel_init_table = XtCreateWidget(\"table\",xpTableWidgetClass,\n\t\t\t\t\t  model_init_form_view,args,n);\n\n\t\t/* create_form_widget does create and position table\t*/\n\t\t/* widget's childs.

There is no much of\nopinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.\n(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although\njust as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make\nany decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. \nHowever, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.\n\nBuddy Christyono\nbuddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nsummary of replies\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHello Buddy,\n\nI do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have\nDD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.\n\nHere is my suggestion...\n\n1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with\n\tDOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that\n\tfor $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other\n\tutilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you \n\tare now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)\n\n2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95\n\tfor the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I\n\tdecided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!\n\tI have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with\n\tlarge SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It\n\tworks great.  Not delays.  I think the \"A\" is better than \"B\" \n\targuements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.\n\tI am looking forward to being able to \"LOADHIGH\" the DD sw.  That\n\thas been an annoyance.\n\n3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the\n\teffort to upgrade.\n\nJust my $.02 ...\n\nRegards,\nMark Bagdy\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nBuddy,\n\nI got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The\ndocumentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic\ninstallation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.\n\nThere were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max\n& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a\n203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had\n~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows\nswap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and\nsuch).\n\nI have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it\ntakes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very\nhappy camper.\n\n-Bruce\n-- \n  Bruce F.

It was very easy to install.\nThe only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game\nwas trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed\nregion of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. \nThere was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.\n\tCompression performance for the whole disk has held steady \naround 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files \nare compressed image files and some large zip files.  \n\nIf you have any more specific questions let me know.\nDan\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI bought it an have been happy with it.  I use it on both MFM and IDE 40\nMB drives.  I was using DoubleDisk before Gold came out.  That is the\nsame product MSDOS 6.0 is shipping with.

The priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any\ndecisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it's easier to \"try\nsomething new\" than it is to refuse to allow it.\n\n   At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet\n(\"Who wants to get around people's feet,\" according to one of our\npriests) the congregation was \"invited\" to come up and help wash one\nanother's hands.\n\n   The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused to\nparticipate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up with\nrubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. \"Body of Christ\" -- \"Amen\"\nfor receiving Communion), that they could be \"I am not responsible for\nthe blood of this man.\"\n\n   Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer (\"Blessed are You, God of\nall creation...\") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  The\npriest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to\nothers, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion\nthat night (we aren't required to anyway -- I instead offered up\nprayers for our priests and parish).\n\n>So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass\n>going down?

But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should \n>just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational\n>participation in Catholic Masses lately?\n\n   The quality of the Mass has not changed.  Again, if it were to be\ncelebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it would\nstill be \"liturgically\" beautiful.  The problem comes about from\npeople trying to be \"creative\" who are not.\n\n   I think the answer to your question on participation could be that\ngiven by Father Peter Stravinskas in answer to the question posed by\nthe title of Thomas Day's _Why Catholics Can't Sing_.  \"They don't\nwant to\" because of all this nonsense.\n\n   By the way, for any non-Catholics reading this, the problem does\nnot reflect bad liturgy by the Catholic Church, but by those who are\ndisobedient to the Church in changing it on their own \"authority.\"\n\n-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\nSteve Creps, Indiana University\ncreps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu\n", "From: delliott@access.digex.com (David N.

Would you talk nicely?  Would you say please?  You\nwouldn't.  The language of the middle east is power and force.  Sorry - that\nis the way it is now.  If you aren't strong, you go down.  Israel has to talk \nand act tough.  Notice, Israel talks and acts tough in battle, but is willing\nto talk peace.\n\n>The way I see it, Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace\n>after almost 50 years of fighting because of the following two major reasons:\n\n> 1) Arab governments are not really representative of their people, currently\n>    most of their leaders are stupid, and/or not independent, and/or\n>    dictators.\n\nTrue - and they have brainwashed their people into thinking Jews are some sort\nof monsters.  Arab non-recognition of Israel and support of war and terror\nis also an important factor, wouldn't you say?\n\n> 2) Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising.\n\nWhat do you want Israel to do?  They are negotating? I'm sick of people calling\nfor Israel to withdraw from the territories now.  That's not realistic, don't\nyou realize that?  A solution must be negotiated.  It is on the table.

My car has 11,500\nmiles on it and is a '92 model.  The NX2000 the dealer is selling is a '91\nmodel with 23,000miles on it.  It has a T-Bar Roof, a/c, and an airbag,\nwhich my Sentra does not have.  They are asking for $1500.  Is that a fair\ndeal?  The only thing I noticed about the NX2000 is that the engine did not\nseem to have as much torque as my Sentra which has the same identical\nengine.  I presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine\nto it's limits occassionaly while I did that on mine, thuis the NX2000's\nengine is a little \"tight.\"  So, if I buy the NX2000 and \"excercise\" it\nwell, should that slight power problem go away?

It is not surprising then that Arabs\noften accuse others (infidels) of things that they are quite familiar\nwith: civil rights violations, religious discrimination, ethnic\ncleansing, land theft, torture and murder.
