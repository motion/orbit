I'm very happy to announce today that we're releasing Center into private beta.

Orbit Center solves a problem our team has been been thinking and working on for years: how do we
build things together ten times more easily. And importantly, how do we build things that actually
make a difference in our day to day work.

We want to build something special, so we took our time getting here. What started as a cluster of
interviews, frustrations and ideation, and hard-won iteration has slowly formed into something we
now feel is useful and fun.

We aim to make it far easier to build commons apps. To do that, Orbit comes with an incredibly rich
toolkit and development environment. For the first time you can just download an app and begin
building production-grade apps without touching the command line.

## The always-on HUD for your day

A nice way to think of Orbit is as an on-device heads up display. It's a lot like Spotlight, if you
could build apps on top it and launch them to your desktop.

Orbit apps have a few principles that make them fun and easy to use.

### Keep it light

Every Orbit app should have a single purpose, and show only a single main screen with an optional
list next to it.

### Always searchable

Orbit has an always-on searchbar for everything. And with a single property you any table or list in
Orbit becomes searchable.

### Wildly open

Orbit apps work together. That's not marketing speak, it's the most key concept behind the platform.
Every app can have any of the following abilities:

- Sync - import data into a common format, called a Bit.
- Display - it's own content, embedded into any other app.
- API - expose a Typescript API to any other app.
- Graph can expose a GraphQL API to any other app.

This makes for a perfect "workspace" for your team to collaborate on apps together. It also unlocks
huge abilities that our platforms just don't attempt, as their apps are completely closed.

A great example is the Slack app. The Slack app uses all four abilities: Sync, Graph, Display, and
API. That means once you import the Slack API

### Default private

Orbit apps run entirely offline, locally on your device. Thats right: you can firewall the upload on
the Orbit app and nothing will leave your computer. We think this is so important - how can you
build a unified data platformw wihtout trust and control? That answer is, you can't.
