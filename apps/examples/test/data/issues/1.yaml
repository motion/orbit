title: Editor doesn't load properly in Safari
author: Nick Cammarata
integration: github
type: issue
text: This is because Safari doesn’t support new Proxy, which is used in various ways. We have a couple options here shim using a JS library, or rewrite some of the bits to not use the proxy. Since the proxy code isn’t actually necessary, I think we might want to go in that direction. What do you think @John?
