next

* slack sync
  * grouping messages into logical chunks?
    * first: time split by inactive periods
    * then further split big ones somehow if need
* various polish
  * prefix integration type search

queued ux stuff

* overdrive
  * may need to fork it
  * need to fix text resizing based on how we end up doing that
  * need to make it work with animations (not be outside the frame, or pause before animate)
* hoverSettler: if under delay amount, dont reset the wait time
  * use case: move off of items quickly and back on, should be instant not re-delay
* bug option+space doesnt focus input text
* hold option when text is selected and hit "delete" or other char, should pin
* clicked vs hovered selections -- see AppReactions TODO
* pin-on-click only when option holding
* faster hover item highlight reaction time
* fix unpin glitchy animation
* if large window, slide in from left side full height
* OCR scanning - once its paused again it doesnt move wiht app anymore

* high ux:
  * should use mouse movement to prevent unwanted highlights

notes

* potential metrics to

  * saved time searching
  * saved contextual switches
  * time reduced in slack/email
