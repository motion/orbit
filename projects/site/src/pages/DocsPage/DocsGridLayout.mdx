The `<GridLayout />` is a smart layout component for laying out an application. It's recommended for
many types of simple internal apps from dashboards to flows, because it handles large amounts of
views well, and including helpful features like sorting and resizing.

The difference between a `<GridLayout />` and a `<Grid />` is the amount of work they do for you.
The Grid component is a simple CSS Grid layout, with a couple properties to help make them easier to
design. Meanwhile, `<GridLayout />` doesn't accept _any_ CSS Grid properties, it handles the content
itself, but is more powerful in terms of laying out content and allowing resizing.

To use a GridLayout:

```tsx
import { GridLayout } from '@o/ui'
```
