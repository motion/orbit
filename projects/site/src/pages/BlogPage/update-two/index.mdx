I'm excited to start talking about Orbit. It's been an intense development period, so it's great to get it out into the world. We're sending alpha builds to [mailing list subscribers](https://tryorbit.com) now, please do sign up!

Orbit is a private personal work assistant. It has two basic assumptions:

- You want to easily get answers and quickly find things from across your work information.
- You don't want to give up any privacy in order to do that.

The rest of this post basically goes heavily into our vision and history. If you'd just like to try Orbit, just sign up or skip to the end to learn how to follow more.

## Why Orbit

You read, write, email, chat, document, ticket... from Slack to Jira, GDocs to Github. Your knowledge is distributed across many services and a wiki or portal doesn't keep up -- they add another source of truth, a cumbersome point of interaction, and infrastructure.

There's a trend in the world thats preventing us collaborating effectively. I think it's actually best explained by the gap between the sci-fi interfaces we dream of in film and TV, and the reality of how we work today.
