  ## Drag and Drop:
  Files can be dropped into the File Browser or Editor in Figma to import them.

  The File Browser supports FIG, SKETCH, PNG, JPG, and GIF file import.
  The Editor supports SVG, PNG, JPG, and GIF file import.
  ## Copy/Paste:
  Figma also imports with high quality via copy-paste to the Editor.

  “Copy” in Illustrator → “Paste” in Figma
  “Copy As SVG” in Sketch → “Paste” in Figma
  “Copy” in Figma → “Paste” in Figma (works across tabs too)
