## Website 2.0

Needs to be far more "sleek" and show in depth certain features. The ideal would feel professional, with autoplay short videos of the various features.

Can be a one page no need for features section.

Incorporate some artistic design elements as well. See JSConf generative and the wavy bauhaus stuff we have.

Strategy should be to just get the content down first though. Really get each section flowing. Leave empty boxes for imagery.

Think Apple Mohave page.

Iterate on that until it has a nice feel.

Refine for mobile, add nice parallax effects.

Then get the videos in once we have features ready.

In depth feature sections:

- Header/splash
- Video of desktop
- Natural search
- Profiles
- More Flexible Integrations.
- A whole new model (private to you)
- Smarter search (x in y, @, # filters)
- Stay up to date (recent activity on home)
- Beta now signup
