A `<Surface />` and it's parent, `<SizedSurface />` allow for easily creating elements that are
common in many UIs, especially Buttons and Inputs.

A Surface basically lets you add an icon before or after its contents, along with shadows, glints,
badges, and theme support built in. A SizedSurface adds sizing props, which let you control border
radius, padding, height, and more in a consistent manner, all of which scale linearly as you
increase the `size` prop.

To see Surfaces in action, check out the docs for:

- [Inputs](/docs/inputs)
