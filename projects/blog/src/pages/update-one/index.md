_Note_: this is a message for early insiders, please don't share the link. I'll go into a bit more detail on future product and distribution plans.

I'm certainly excited to start talking about Orbit. It's been an intense few years of development and I'm happy we can start to put it out into the world.

But first, the great news. Our alpha build is now [available for download](). While some interesting pieces are not yet in place, we pushed hard to get to where you can use it and give feedback.

So, what's Orbit? Let's start with our mission:

> To create a new [aggregation platform](https://stratechery.com/2017/defining-aggregators/) that gives individuals control over siloed web data to create a more flexible, powerful and intuitive knowledge exploration.

Orbit is a new type of thing. It's trying to answer a question that I think that summarizes a variety of pain points we feel today:

What's preventing us from exploring our data like Iron Man?

<div style="font-size: 11px; text-align: center; margin: -1.5rem 0 1rem; opacity: 0.5;">
  and how long could you really keep your arms up like that?

Orbit won't make you Iron Man. It won't even have all the visual effects. But I do think sci-fi movies get at one important desire that the world today lacks.

**I want to be able to explore my information in a unified way.**

From what you've read to what you've talked about, from Slack to Jira to your team Google Drive, our information has become more and more distributed, and less and less easy to understand.

Orbit want to be a new type of thing: the mid-point between a Browser and an Operating System. It will give knowledge a platform to be easier to understand, search, explore and extend. Operating systems gave us files, and with that the control to organize, search, and extend, but the trend towards web apps has been entirely anti-Iron Man. Everything with it's own interface, and nothing we can control.

We want:

- To navigate important knowledge quickly and easily.
- To search it intuitively: by person, topic, and time.
- To have it augment us, as we work, in context.
- To install and build new apps on top of it easily.
- To do all of this without having to give up our privacy and security.

Orbit's goal is make this real. Here's a demo:

### From Roadblock to Feature: Distribution

Orbit wants to be a _platform for knowledge management_ and replace most of clunky and stale intranet systems today. To do that, it needs to crawl all of your information. But that creates a misaligned incentive we discovered early in our user research:

_No one wants to trust any single company with all their data._

This was a big roadblock. Enterprise sales cycles felt peripheral to the large problem of building a better knowledge manager. But it was impossible to get even close friends to install it at work without wanting permission from managers, a demo, etc.

It was later as we struggled with a way around the sales problem that we had a realization: today computers are powerful. They have large disks and fast processors. Further, accurate NLP algorithms have become incredibly fast.

1. Cloud - Have to trust security, lower UX, but easy to develop.
2. On-premise - Secure, high install cost, large sales cycle, harder to develop.
3. **Decentralized/On Device** - Secure, low install cost, high UX, but limited compute and harder development.

So we tested our theory of NLP and compute power, and with some interesting work there we're confident we can do good search locally. The rest perfectly aligned with our incentives.

<div style="margin: 2.5rem -20%; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
  <div style="margin: auto;  max-width: 100vw;">
    <img alt="On-Device = Data stays on your computer" src="./illustration.svg" />
  </img>
</div>

This means you can try Orbit at no cost and with no risk. No data privacy issues, no time talking to sales, no expensive installation. Just download the app.

This also aligns us with what we think is important: **the product must actually be good**. We aren't incentivized to invest into sales, so we can invest more into a great experience.

### The details

[Skip to the end](#going-forward) if you aren't interested in feature-level details! This section goes into some of what we've built and some that are in early development.

<div style="width: 480px; border-radius: 20px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; right: -520px;">

</div>

#### Home

The Orbit Home is a flexible unified search and exploration tool for your data. For now it's a lot like Spotlight with some recent activity and a directory of people.

> Option+Space opens Orbit Home

#### Bit

We're calling a "file" in orbit a "Bit". Where SaaS products have data behind unique interfaces and APIs, Orbit apps sync to a common fundamental unit: the bit, which can be text or HTML, for now.

#### Language

Orbit comes with a [state of the art](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08493.pdf) Natural Language engine. Importantly, it runs quickly on-device and custom to you: it's relevancy is powered by both interesting words in English as well as their relative frequency in your corpus. This powers our search, related items, and interesting word extraction.

#### Context

Context will be the first big step Orbit does to deliver on the "future of computing". It's powered by a custom OCR engine we've built that focuses on one thing: being the fastest in the world. We're close to getting it to use <1% of your total laptop battery.

Why an OCR engine? Whether writing an email in Mail.app, talking on Slack, browsing the Web, or really doing anything you do on your computer, Orbit understands what you are looking at.

Combined with our Language engine, it means we can do _meaningful search_ to find extremely relevant items within your knowledgebase based on whatever you're doing. But that's just the start. We can also highlight words and show apps next to them, and script triggers based on activity, words, and other contextual information.

We have both the OCR, NLP, and UI working. But we need a few more months to get it to be more stable, useful and well implemented.

#### Apps

Some beautiful apps come out of the box: Gmail, Google Docs, Github, Slack, Jira, and Confluence. We will add more flexible ones next such as Web and API crawlers.

<div style="display: flex; flex-flow: row; height: 120px; max-width: 100%; justify-content: space-between; padding: 30px 0;">
  <img class="icon" src="./icons/gdrive.svg" />
  <img class="icon" src="./icons/github.svg" />
  <img class="icon" src="./icons/gmail.svg" />
  <img class="icon" src="./icons/jira.svg" />
  <img class="icon" src="./icons/confluence.svg" />
  <img class="icon" src="./icons/slack.svg" />
</div>

But we can't predict what apps and views on them will be most useful due to the incredible stochasticity of information and its uses. But I do think we can build a set of APIs that enable building those experiences.

So with all these pieces in place, we're aiming at releasing an App Store early next year. We'll expose Language and Context, and combine it with our UI Kit and an one-click decentralized distribution. Which means you can build and deploy apps to your team with no tooling, no infrastructure, and an amazing UI out of the box.

### Going forward

There's a lot more I'd like to write, but I think is more than enough to start. I'll end with something that will risk sounding clich√©:

The biggest feature of Orbit is trust. If you don't feel it will respect your privacy in the long run, it wont get off the ground. Much like a Browser or Operating System, it should be a fundamental tool you trust to handle sensitive information.

We've designed it in the only way we know that guarantees that for now: by never sending data off your device. As we go decentralized we'll have to continue to make good security decisions.

Of course, trust doesn't matter if your product doesn't meet real needs. The next feed months will be exciting as we attempt to do that. I'm happy to have you on board early, and your feedback will be the most important part of ensuring that!
