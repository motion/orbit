# Orbit

1. Allow anyone in your organization to immediately build apps, without setting up anything - development environment, getting server keys, build tooling, understanding data flow, plugging in data sources.

2. Save a huge amount of developer time.

3. Build small apps that work together without having to glue them together.

Highly Collaborative Apps:

"The Pitch / Network Effect of Orbit"

Today, every tech company or company of any scale builds their own intranet. Some use WYSIWIG solutions, but many also have custom apps. There are big incumbents in these fields, but they are running on extremely old technology or are very hard to use and control (Salesforce, Mulesoft).

Orbit wants to do for Intranet apps what Slack did for messaging: lower the bar so far down to getting started, while at once raising the user experience and quality to 10x above where its at now.

It does this by thinking an app platform from scratch: instead of running in some cloud where you control nothing, it runs on your desktop and feels like a new desktop app platform for native apps; the only difference: you can _collaborate on_ and and _sync data_ from the apps together with your team.

That's a whole new way to think about an application: it's not stuck in the cloud, but it's also not stuck on your desktop. You get the best of both worlds: you control the code and all the data lives locally, but you can still work together with your team.

It has the following order of magnitude improvements:

1. Going from 0 to deploying an app is incredibly easy
2. Building apps uses all native and standardized tooling
3. Deploy with a click of a button
4. Apps contain a huge ui kit and features to make your life easy

So what about the network effect?

Well, it's actually really big. The reason is, Orbit apps can be pushed to an app store, and then downloaded and edited. Our goal is to make it trivial for many people at many different companies to work on *the same apps* together.

Intranet systems contain many of the same features. They show data in certian ways, they show users, etc. Companies don't consider these features to be IP they want to protect, so this is a natural area to collaborate.

Imagine you can install an app someone has built, that lets you manage your postgres database. Well, because it's in the open app store, there can be hundred of people working on that app: upgrading its features and fixing bugs together. You get those for free, and with no downside: if you ever want to opt-out you can use and fork any old version for your needs.

So you literally are building out your intranet collaboratively with everyone else using Orbit.
