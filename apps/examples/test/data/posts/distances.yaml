  You can measure distances, in pixels, between objects on your canvas with the steps below

  ## Select an object
  Hold the alt/option key while hovering your cursor over other objects
  Figma will display redline distances to nearby edges.

  Also, if you have Guides on your frames you can now measure distances between objects in the frame and those guides.
