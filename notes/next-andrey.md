Organizing general plan for Andrey start, as best I can see.

Generally these are not set in stone and we can work through them. Just a good source of truth for our best list of next up.

Github is just a little too heavy for us at this point.

Goal: Getting Apps to build/share

1. A way to publish and receive published apps (npm powered, like vscode)
2. A service for publishing apps online with various commands / CRUD
3. Link that service into orbit-app AppsIndex search

Goal: Syncing configuration and other information p2p

1. App config and space config should sync through hyperswarm
2. Link that into Spaces and testing it out

Goal: Apps store for p2p

1. In the same way public one works, but instead uses hyperswarm
2. Allow for teams to collaborate without publicly sharing anything
3. May need some consideration for linking to github repo (instead, in addition to?)
