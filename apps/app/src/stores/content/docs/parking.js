In some cities, DeliverX offers pay adjustments to help with parking tickets received while working or dropping off deliveries. If eligible, DeliverX will add an adjustment for your first qualifying ticket. Thereafter, DeliverX will adjust for qualifying tickets if you’ve delivered 100 orders since your last adjustment. Only tickets received at the pickup or drop-off location and within the delivery window are eligible for adjustments. All parking adjustments are at DeliverX’s sole discretion.
 
Note that you are still responsible for paying the ticket, that you must be authorized to deliver by car in order to be eligible for an adjustment, and that your insurance and vehicle information must be up to date. We also do not cover late fees. 
 
Please see the “local” section for full details on your local parking ticket policy and a list of qualifying tickets.`
