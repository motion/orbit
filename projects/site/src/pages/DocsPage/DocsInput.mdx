<IntroText>The Input element is for common text inputs from users.</IntroText>

All form elements are usable through the `<FormFields />` or just `<Form />`, making it much easier
to write simple and common use cases for forms.

An `<Input />` is a simple extension of a `<Surface />`, which handles a few common styling patterns
for Inputs. Inputs are only meant to handle text, unlike their HTML counterparts, though they do
support `type` for many textual-type inputs.

Other form fields supported include `<Select />`, `<Checkbox />`, `<Toggle />`, and more.

To use a Input:

```tsx
import { Input } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples

### Basics

<Example id="Basic" />

### Sizing

As any Surface, Input accept all the `<SizedSurface />` properties.

<Example id="Sized" name="Sizing" />

### Using in a group

One big feature of Surfaces is that they support being used in groups automatically. So putting
together an Input, with a Button, can look like this:

<Example id="Grouped" name="Grouping" />

### Sizing and using in a group

You may want to then control the properties of every item in a group. There are a few ways to do
this. First is through `<PassProps />`, which works well with Row/Col, preserving the space/group
properties. The alternate, which only works for surfaces, is to use `<SurfacePassProps>`, which uses
context to pass props to the next level of surfaces, no matter how deep down they are.

<Example id="GroupedSized" name="Sizing and grouping" />
