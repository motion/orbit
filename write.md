# Unsilo (Cloud Lock-In)

* looking around at the cloud theres a hell of a lot of silos
* gsuite cloud search
* only works for google services
* ms365
* only works for microsoft
* Dropbox, Jira, etc
* Our knowledge is locked into platforms
* But they don't operate in the same platforms, ideally
* slack
* confluence, intercom, etc
* how to solve lock in?
* a company dedicated to unifying cloud services.
* its _sole mission_ must be to unify the cloud
* but it has to do it without breaking permission, security.

Orbit does that.

# A Decentralized Intranet

* intranets solve the same problems: curation, news, search, profiles
* but they dont work how we work now: across many services
* they are always out of date, because they dont use our sources of truth
* install is a huge pain:
  * on-prem is laborious and expensive
  * cloud is insecure and creates permissions hell
* on device is the answer:
  * completely secure
  * install can be instant and painless
* p2p can sync any metadata for curation
* aggregation is the new curation
* machine intelligence for smart answers, summaries and more
* eventually deploy apps internally with ease
* Orbit

# The Stunning Lack of Ambition of OS X Mojave

* We were promised Software 2.0
* iOS gets: Notification noise reduction
  * where is that on OS X?
* Dark theme is the big feature
* Why does spotlight not search your cloud services?
* Does anyone use Notification center on Mac?
* This looks like a Step release
* WAIT
* Apple focusing on performance is important and good
* but it leaves room for companies doing intelligent software
* and especially for work related tooling
* desktop software doesnt work with us

Knowledge Management is Broken

* Confluence, MediaWiki -- Slow, Stale, Cumbersome
* Notion and other newcomers -- Just copying the old players with a slightly better interface
* Knowledge still has big problems:
  * It's hidden
  * It goes stale
  * It doesn't source Slack, Github, etc
  * It requires active searching
  * It sacrifices privacy or requires a huge install
* We're building orbit to fix all of that, [here's how it does it[(#10).

Software 2.0, The Anti-Cloud, and Revolutionizing Knowledge Management

* On desktop: at hand, upgrading Spotlight
* Stale: Unifying sources, topic based grouping, cosal
* Passive search, not always active
* Aggregation of knowledge: Experts, Projects
* Private, no install

Why MVPs no Longer Work for Most Things

* very Thiel article
* hard things become more important
* You can still fake the general pitch
* but as software 2.0 becomes more prevalent the quality of the product bar goes higher
* machine learning becomes more used
* interfaces are becoming more complex and require more thought
* problem sets have to integrate lots of data, bigger data, more disparate
* saturation for typical products is so high
  * can you imagine another trello coming into pm tools now?
* now startups must tackle big problems

The Great Cloud Blind Spot

* on how SaaS has become over-done, and desktop software is now under-valued
* patio11 wrote an article about why desktop wasn't as good (for bingo creator)
* but his article is unpersuasive:
  * mac app store has improved and is improving more and more
  * now has easier payment story
  * so his 2x conversion is likely not as relevant
  * also some apps are great for web, but some arent
* the desktop has some big advantages:
  * better user experience
  * can be always on
  * easier to integrate with notifications
  * better shortcuts, cross-app communication
  * more power with files
  * more stickiness long term
  * easier multiprocess
  * can use python, go, rust, swift as needed
