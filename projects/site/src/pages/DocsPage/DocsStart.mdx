<IntroText>
  Welcome to the Orbit user manual. This documentation is designed to help you get building with
  Orbit even if you aren't a programmer. If you are a programmer, well, good for you.
</IntroText>

Getting started with Orbit is simple and doesn't require setting up any development environment.
Orbit comes with everything you need.

You may be wondering right about now, _what the hell is Orbit, anyway?_. That's reasonable, you may want to start with our blog post [What the Hell is Orbit?](/) in that case.

If you don't mind not understanding things before diving in (that's ok, we do it all the time too), then
we'd have to recommend checking the sidebar for the [Quick Start]() or [Building an app]() tutorials.
