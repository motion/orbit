# Orbit

Orbit is much more heavily invested in "up front" than most any startup, even the newest ones it competes against. This is mostly technology, we can discuss the various pieces but basically:

## Technology

in sum: we have a shitload and its really well positioned.

- doing it on-device requires a lot of work, from syncing efficiently to storing carefully to indexing, to doing performant on-device NLP and search. we've solved all of this
- the interface has massive room to grow and all the tech is working to power that already. this includes much much more intuitive and quick movement, multi apps, augmenting your operating system with windows, showing marks on your screen, etc
- the stack itself is also far beyond anyone near us. its a massive monorepo where we control just about every piece and they all work together extremely closely and well. it was a risk to invest in it but the risk is now paying back. we built much of it during the three years previous doing multiple startups: we have incredibly great syntax and abstractions for logic and views together as well as libraries from top to bottom from intense popovers, lists, panes, selections, filtering, etc which is really important for making it all flow. not just that but impressive HMR and intense REPL scripting for amazing development speed
- generally the entire UI kit is massive and fleshed out, far more than it should be as a relic of past startups and my life history. we have extreme ability to move quickly, from virtual lists to very intricate and keyboard navigable popovers to table views, lists, segmented controls, etc. even mature ui kits at the big companies lack many features we have
- and the important thing is we control it top to bottom and develop every piece of it in unison on our device with no complex infrastrucure. we've really overindexed for developer speed, and still have a lot of juice we can squeeze here.

## Interface

It's hard to overemphasize the difficulty and importance of interface. We spent a ton of time getting this right (think: almost a year of intense experimentation and prototyping). We had to redo it completely at least 4 times. We built up a huge colleciton of quality components and abstractions to make it possible. We're deep into refining it so it feels amazing. This is not easy stuff, and no one is even close, and it's so important.

## Featureset

It's both a lack of features, the interface for them, the way the are implemented, and the depth of polish. We are working on the last piece, but the features we've landed on are hard earned and valuable. Now we just need to make them work fluidly. We have quite a few things I think that are so different from what everyone else is even thinking of that makes all the difference:

- Easily switch between spaces
- Unified profiles of people in your space
- A ton of iteration into search / NLP

##

## Direction

- App store and becoming the next Mac / iOS platform for simple apps

## Wow

- OCR and augmented computing

## Brand

Need to redo how it's pitched. Instead of some appeal to silos or history of ERP/distributed teams, or any of that, pitch it as the next version of Mac/iOS.

It's actually the platform that could unify them and be iOS X2 / Mac X2.

How?

It's the new homescreen of iOS, and the new launch menu for Mac X2.
