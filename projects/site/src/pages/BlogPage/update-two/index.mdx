I'm excited to be introducing Orbit today, as we start our private beta.

Orbit is a platform for building powerful apps as easily as possible, focused on letting your team
collaborate on internal tools. What sort of tools? Orbit does a couple things really well:
connecting data sources, and displaying large amount of data easily. It has a lot of things that
help with common internal apps:

- Querying a database and visualizing the data.
- Displaying results from an API in an editable list.
- Allowing realtime editing of rich content.
- Any sort of dashboard, CRUD app, or simple searchable tool.

Our goal is to make development of these tools as rich and easy as possible without sacrificing
power. [Sign up to the insider list](#end), for updates and an invite to early access.

Our goal is to make app-building far easier, faster and more powerful - so you can focus on what
matters. To do that, Orbit ships with an incredibly rich toolkit and development environment. For
the first time you can just download an app and begin building production-grade apps without
touching the command line.

## The always-on HUD for your day

A really nice way to think of Orbit is as a heads up display. Like Spotlight, if you could build
apps on top of it, and if those apps could provide thier own data sources.

Why did we build Orbit to run on your computer and not on the web? Mainly becuase we think the web
is part of the problem Orbit wants to fix. Namely, we want a place where you go to unify your data,
not a place where you browse. Making Orbit a desktop app gives us much more control over the
experience, and gives you much more control over your apps, data, and privacy. More on that to come.

Orbit has a few principles that make it fun.

### Keep it light

Every Orbit app should have a single purpose, and show only a single main screen with an optional
list next to it.

### Everything searchable

Orbit has an always-on searchbar for everything. And with a single property you any table or list in
Orbit becomes searchable.

### Wildly open

Orbit apps work together. That's not marketing speak, it's the most key concept behind the platform.
Every app can have any of the following abilities:

- Sync - import data into a common format, called a Bit.
- Display - it's own content, embedded into any other app.
- API - expose a Typescript API to any other app.
- Graph can expose a GraphQL API to any other app.

This makes for a perfect "workspace" for your team to collaborate on apps together. It also unlocks
huge abilities that our platforms just don't attempt, as their apps are completely closed.

A great example is the Slack app. The Slack app uses all four abilities: Sync, Graph, Display, and
API. That means once you import the Slack API

### Secure first

Orbit apps run entirely offline, locally on your device. Thats right: you can firewall the upload on
the Orbit app and nothing will leave your computer. We think this is so important - how can you
build a unified data platformw wihtout trust and control? That answer is, you can't.

## A brief history

Orbit didn't start as an internal tools platform, and in the future it wants to expand to be a
platform for anyone -- the most fun way to build real-world applications for any platform. If you
want to understand better some of what Orbit is doing, read on. If you just want to know more on the
_how_, skip ahead to the next section.

## A look forward
