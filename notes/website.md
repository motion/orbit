# Orbit

Your [company | knowledge | apps | life], in context.

Orbit is the first of it's kind: a knowledge augmentation assistant. We've all seen the future: we all wear AR glasses and they keep us in sync, providing a fluent interface to search across anything we need, remember anything we saw, and augment us as we work.

We all remember a certain metallic assistant of the past, with fear.
