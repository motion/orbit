As human beings, we are prone to focus on very dramatic, visible events, such as confrontations with political enemies or the personal qualities of leaders, whether good or bad. We turn information about politics and economics into stories of good guys versus bad guys and identify progress with the triumph of the good guys. In the process, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to neglect the underlying forces that improve life in small, hard-to-observe ways, culminating in important changes.\n\nHere is Alex's earlier post on African success in the decade.\u00c2\u00a0 In addition to growth statistics, I see much of the developing world as having demonstrated a much higher than expected level of social and political cohesion.\u00c2\u00a0 Excerpt:\n\nSince 2007, according to Goldman Sachs, the biggest emerging markets\u00e2\u20ac\u201cBrazil, Russia, India and China\u00e2\u20ac\u201chave accounted for 45% of global growth, almost twice as much as in 2000-06 and three times as much as in the 1990s.\n\nArnold Kling notes: \"Even in the United States, the fact that people are living healthier longer represents an improvement above and beyond the GDP statistics.\"\nI did not have enough space to discuss\u00c2\u00a0the question of growth rates versus per capita growth rates, but here are a few relevant points:\n1. Babies are pretty cheap to feed.\u00c2\u00a0 In the short run, if your economy grows, and at the same time produces more infants, the adults are still better off.\n2. In the longer run, developing countries are making the \"demographic transition\" quicker and more dramatically\u00c2\u00a0than had been expected.\u00c2\u00a0 Mexico is an extreme example of this more general point.\u00c2\u00a0 So if you are very worried about overpopulation (not my view), there still has been plenty of good demographic news in the last decade.\u00c2\u00a0 Economic growth in the developing world will not be \"swallowed up\" by rising population.\n3. \"More children\" can be a legitimate way for a country to enjoy higher living standards.\n4. Social indicators such as water and sanitation in households are generally higher in the afore-cited countries, over the\u00c2\u00a0last decade.\u00c2\u00a0 That's further evidence for #1.\nAgain, I'd like to stress the general point that most American-born economists are not sufficiently cosmopolitan in their thinking and writing.\n", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fruitful Decade for Many in the World\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"index": 12, "text": "1.

Competition among models may be necessary to insure that the benefits of the models exceeds their cost.\n(Applications to the financial crisis are apposite.)\nAddendum: Bryan Caplan also comments.\u00c2\u00a0 As Bryan notes, a very good economist can use PPFs and still get the story right.\n", "title": "Soviet Growth & American Textbooks"}, {"index": 16, "text": "He enumerates fourteen interesting points, here is one of them:\n\n2.

The lottery generates exogenous variation in the degree of ethnic diversity across clusters within the complex, which is rare among adult households. I conduct an original survey of 1363 households focusing on attitudes about members of the other religion and willingness to live together. To overcome concerns about self-presentation bias, I also measure implicit attitudes via an Implicit Association Test (IAT) for a representative sub-sample. My estimates demonstrate location influences interactions in that individuals spend significant time with others in their cluster. Increased proximity and interaction, in turn, affect attitudes. Greater exposure to Muslims (the minority group) improves Hindus' explicit attitudes about Muslims by 0.25 to 0.40 standard deviations, depending on the measure, and increases their willingness to live with Muslims. Paralleling this, I observe significant reductions in implicit bias (0.20 to 0.57 standard deviations) among Hindu children. While I observe no significant effects for Muslims, the overall effect is a convergence of attitudes across religious groups. As India expands public housing for the poor to accommodate rapid urbanization, deliberate mixing of religious groups can be a way of improving attitudes toward the religious minority. \n\nYou can find the paper, along with her other work, here.\n", "title": "Evidence from India on neighborhood diversity"}, {"index": 37, "text": "\nState officials admited that the prison was built in an isolated location to avoid competition \"with the honest mechanical classes.\"\n\nThat's about Clinton State Prison, built in 1845 and the anecdote is from Timothy Gilfoyle's A Pickpocket's Tale: The Underworld of Nineteenth-Century New York.\u00c2\u00a0 Here is my previous post on the book.\n", "title": "Prison protectionism"}, {"index": 38, "text": "Millions of people suffer from kidney disease, but in 2007 there were just 64,606 kidney-transplant operations in the entire world.\nToday in the WSJ I discuss innovative solutions\u00c2\u00a0to the worldwide shortage of transplant organs from places like \u00c2\u00a0Iran, India, Singapore, Israel and elsewhere. \u00c2\u00a0One interesting bit I haven't blogged about before is routine removal of organs without the donor's or their families consent. \u00c2\u00a0China? \u00c2\u00a0No. \u00c2\u00a0America. \u00c2\u00a0It's been legal here for decades.\n\nIn a number of U.S. states, medical examiners conducting autopsies may and do harvest corneas with little or no family notification.

Philosophers have been debating the dividing line between baldness and nonbaldness for over 2,000 years, so there is little hope that the dividing line between life and death will ever be agreed upon. Indeed, the great paradox of deceased donation is that we must draw the line between life and death precisely where we cannot be sure of the answer, because the line must lie where the donor is dead but the donor's organs are not. \nIn 1968 the Journal of the American Medical Association published its criteria for brain death. But reduced crime and better automobile safety have led to fewer potential brain-dead donors than in the past. Now, greater attention is being given to donation after cardiac death: no heart beat for two to five minutes (protocols differ) after the heart stops beating spontaneously. Both standards are controversial\u00e2\u20ac\u201cthe surgeon who performed the first heart transplant from a brain-dead donor in 1968 was threatened with prosecution, as have been some surgeons using donation after cardiac death.

However, when the crisis finally did come, the mechanism did not at all resemble the feared sudden stop. Quite the opposite, during the crisis net capital inflows to the U.S. were a stabilizing rather than a destabilizing source. I argue instead that the root imbalance was of a different kind: The entire world had an insatiable demand for safe debt instruments that put an enormous pressure on the U.S. financial system and its incentives (and this was facilitated by regulatory mistakes). The crisis itself was the result of the negative feedback loop between the initial tremors in the financial industry created to bridge the safe-assets gap and the panic associated with the chaotic unraveling of this complex industry. Essentially, the financial sector was able to create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd assets from the securitization of lower quality ones, but at the cost of exposing the economy to a systemic panic. This structural problem can be alleviated if governments around the world explicitly absorb a larger share of the systemic risk. The options for doing this range from surplus countries rebalancing their portfolios toward riskier assets, to private-public solutions where asset-producer countries preserve the good parts of the securitization industry while removing the systemic risk from the banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 balance sheets.

It is shown that both separating and pooling equilibria can exist; as opposed to the classic results in the literature, a pooling equilibrium is still informative. Drugs which allow a gradual loss of control by appropriate doses and for which moderate consumption is not addictive are particularly suitable because the consumption can be easily observed and reciprocated and is unlikely to occur out of the social context. There is a trade-off between the efficiency gains due to the signaling effect and the loss of\u00c2\u00a0productivity associated with intoxication.

In this paper, we argue that campaign contributions are not a form of policy-buying, but are rather a form of political participation and consumption. We summarize the data on campaign spending, and show through our descriptive statistics and our econometric analysis that individuals, not special interests, are the main source of campaign contributions. Moreover, we demonstrate that campaign giving is a normal good, dependent upon income, and campaign contributions as a percent of GDP have not risen appreciably in over 100 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if anything, they have probably fallen. We then show that only one in four studies from the previous literature support the popular notion that contributions buy legislators' votes. Finally, we illustrate that when one controls for unobserved constituent and legislator effects, there is little relationship between money and legislator votes. Thus, the question is not why there is so little money politics, but rather why organized interests give at all.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has contributed essentially to our understanding of reward processing in humans. The strength of reward-related brain responses might prove as a valuable marker for, or correlate of, individual preferences or personality traits. An essential prerequisite for this is a sufficient reliability of individual measures of reward-related brain signals. We therefore determined test-retest reliabilities of BOLD responses to reward prediction, reward receipt and reward prediction errors in the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex in 25 subjects undergoing three different simple reward paradigms (retest interval 7-13 days). Although on a group level the paradigms consistently led to significant activations of the relevant brain areas in two sessions, across subject retest reliabilities were only poor to fair (with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) of -.15 to .44). ICCs for motor activations were considerably higher (ICC .32 to .73). Our results reveal the methodological difficulties behind across-subject correlations in fMRI research on reward processing. These results demonstrate the need for studies that address methods to optimize the retest reliability of fMRI. \n\nHat tip goes to the excellent Vaughn Bell.\u00c2\u00a0 Here are related criticisms.\u00c2\u00a0 Here is a related paper, possibly gated for you, \"Is There a Method for Neuroeconomics?\"\n", "title": "Is this a big uh-oh for neuroeconomics?"}, {"index": 114, "text": "1.

However, studies of street prostitution in the U.S. have revealed only modest wages and considerable risks of disease and violence, casting doubt on EK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premise of an unexplained wage premium.

Analyzing wage information on more than 40,000 escorts in the U.S. and Canada collected from a web site, we find strong support for EK. First, escorts in the sample earn high wages, on average $280/hour. Second, while looks decline monotonically with age, wages follow a hump-shaped pattern, with a peak in the 26-30 age bracket, which coincides with the most intensive marriage ages for women in the U.S. Third, the age-wage profile is significantly flatter, and prices are lower (5%), despite slightly better escort characteristics, in cities that rank high in terms of conferences, suggesting that servicing men in transit is associated with less stigma.

There are two ways to fall out of a plane. The first is to free-fall, or drop from the sky with absolutely no protection or means of slowing your descent.

That classification means you have the advantage of being attached to a chunk of the plane. In 1972, Serbian flight attendant Vesna Vulovic was traveling in a DC-9 over Czechoslovakia when it blew up.

The Census Bureau purposely messes with the microdata a little, to protect the identity of each individual.

In order to make sure the data still give accurate estimates, it is important that they also recode a 36-year-old with similar characteristics as being 37. This gives you the gist of some of their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disclosure avoidance procedures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While it may all sound a bit odd, if these procedures are done properly, the data will yield accurate estimates, while also protecting my identity.

The right response is obvious: fix the programs, and publish corrected data. Unfortunately, the Census Bureau has refused to correct the data.\n\n\n\tThe problem also runs a bit deeper.

Autistic individuals do not in general \"think in pictures,\"\u00c2\u00a0though\u00c2\u00a0some autistics offer this self-description.\u00c2\u00a0 Grandin repeatedly refers to herself in this context.\u00c2\u00a0 I don't read her as claiming this tendency is universal or even the general rule, but the disclaimers aren't as evident as I would like them to be.\u00c2\u00a0\n2. There is little evidence to support her view that autistics \"think like animals.\"\u00c2\u00a0 Here is one published critique of her theory: \"We argue that the extraordinary cognitive feats shown by some animal species can be better understood as adaptive specialisations that bear little, if any, relationship to the unusual skills shown by savants.\"\u00c2\u00a0 You'll find a response by Grandin at that same link.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0I'm not totally on board with the critique either (how well do we understand savants anyway?), but at the very least Grandin's claim is an unsupported hypothesis.\n3.

The biggest leftward move in American economic policy occurred during the Roosevelt and Truman years, when the Democrats had the upper hand for five consecutive presidential terms. Because of depression and war, people were looking for real change. Competitive forces in politics were relatively weak, and the Democrats had the chance to make their policies stick.\nThe Supreme Court\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs recent ruling on campaign spending also comes into clearer focus through the median voter theorem. The court ruled that the government may not ban political spending by corporations in candidate elections. Critics fear that the political influence of corporations will grow, but some academic specialists in campaign finance aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so sure. \nFor all the anecdotal evidence, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to show statistically that money has a large and systematic influence on political outcomes. That is partly because politicians cannot stray too far from public opinion. (In part, it is also because interest groups get their way on many issues by supplying an understaffed Congress with ideas and intellectual resources, not by running ads or making donations.) It is quite possible that the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect election results very much.\n\nHere are the concluding two paragraphs:\n\nThe median voter theorem doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t predict that the legacy of the Obama administration will be a wash. But it does imply that we might find the most important achievements in areas that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always linger on the front page. For instance, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ideas on education, which involve accountability and charter schools and pay for performance, may please the American public and thus make their way into policy. And because education transforms the knowledge and interests of the median voter for generations to come, such acceptance could make for a lot of other improvements.\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for change to believe in, and change that will last, the odds are best when political competition is pushing the world in your direction. \n\nJacob Weisberg has a not unrelated column.\u00c2\u00a0 And, for another perspective,\u00c2\u00a0here are the comments over at Mark Thoma's blog.\u00c2\u00a0 A few further points:\n1. \"How tough Obama is\" matters less than is usually portrayed.\u00c2\u00a0 That is the fallacy of anthromorphizing the outcome of political battles.\u00c2\u00a0 Obsessing over either positive or negative evaluations of key actors probably interferes with one's abilities to understand underlying structural forces.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n2.

If\nyou started the bet any year during the 1980s Simon won eight of the ten decadal\nstart years.

Hispanic incarceration rates are now between 13 and 31 percent above the white average, depending upon which age range we choose for normalization purposes.\n\nAnd this:\n\nAnother important point to emphasize is the wide disparity in white incarceration rates throughout the country, even when adjusted relative to the number of whites in high-crime age ranges. For example, age-adjusted imprisonment rates for whites in large Southern states such as Florida, Texas, and Georgia may be 200 percent or even 300 percent higher than those for whites in large Northeastern or Midwestern states such as New York, New Jersey, or Illinois, as shown in Chart 5. Although it is impossible to disentangle completely how much of this gap may be due to higher criminality and how much due to harsher judicial systems, it seems likely that both play important roles. So even if the age-adjusted Hispanic incarceration rate is somewhat above the white rate\u00e2\u20ac\u201cperhaps 15 percent higher on average\u00e2\u20ac\u201cit still falls close to the center of the overall white distribution.\n\nDon't forget this:\n\nNearly all of the most heavily Latino cities have low or even extremely low crime rates, and virtually none have rates much above the national average. Eighty percent Latino El Paso has the lowest homicide and robbery rates of any major city in the continental United States.

Individual cities may certainly have anomalously low crime rates for a variety of reasons, but the overall trend of crime rates compared to ethnicity seems unmistakable.\n\nAnd this:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6if we restrict our analysis to major cities of half a million people or more and compare the average crime rates for the five most heavily Hispanic cities\u00e2\u20ac\u201cAlbuquerque, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Antonio, and El Paso\u00e2\u20ac\u201cto the those of the five whitest\u00e2\u20ac\u201cOklahoma City, Columbus, Indianapolis, Seattle, and Portland. This time, the more Hispanic cities are the ones with the lower crime rates\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 percent below the white cities in homicide and 15 percent lower in violent crime. A particularly remarkable result is that gigantic Los Angeles\u00e2\u20ac\u201c50 percent Hispanic and frequently perceived as a dangerous urban hellhole\u00e2\u20ac\u201chas violent crime rates close to those of Portland, Oregon, the whitest major city in the nation at 74 percent.\n\nAnd finally:\n\nLos Angeles today ranks as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s least white European large city. Half of the population is Hispanic, and many of these are impoverished illegal immigrants and their families. Yet all crime rates have been falling steadily over the last two decades, with homicide dropping a further 18 percent just last year.

A problem with the new banking system is that it depends on collateral to guarantee the safety of the deposits.\u00c2\u00a0 But, there are many demands for such collateral.\u00c2\u00a0 Foreign governments and investors have significant demands for U.S. Treasury bonds, U.S. agency bonds, and corporate bonds (about 40 percent is held by foreigners).\u00c2\u00a0 Treasury and agency bonds are also needed to collateralize derivatives positions.\u00c2\u00a0 Further, they are needed to use as collateral for clearing and settlement of financial transactions.\u00c2\u00a0 There are few AAA corporate bonds.\u00c2\u00a0 Roughly speaking (which is the best that can be done, given the data available), the total amount of possible collateral in U.S. bond markets, minus the amount held by foreigners, is about $16 trillion.\u00c2\u00a0 The amount used to collateralize derivatives positions (according to ISDA) is about $4 trillion.\u00c2\u00a0 It is not known how much is needed for clearing and settlement.\u00c2\u00a0 Repo needs, say, $12 trillion.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6to get a sense of the magnitudes, suppose the repo market was $12 trillion and that repo haircuts rose from zero to an average of 20 percent.\u00c2\u00a0 Then the banking system would need to come up with $2 trillion, an impossible task.\n\nOne bottom line is this: the repo market funds the banks and there isn't enough \"safety\" to ensure the repo market is always working well.\u00c2\u00a0 We ended up using synthetic securities, including those backed by mortgages.\u00c2\u00a0 So every now and then we get a run on our banks.\u00c2\u00a0 Gorton predicts the crisis was not a one-off event and it could happen again.\nOne implication of this (my inference, not found in the paper) is that most (all?) major current proposals for banking reform don't get at the real problem.\u00c2\u00a0 You might wish to go back to \"old banking\" but according to Gorton that stopped being profitable during the 1980s.\u00c2\u00a0 There's always an uninsured place to put your money, regulation can't stop that, and such money can\u00c2\u00a0find its way\u00c2\u00a0back to help fund the banking system,\u00c2\u00a0right?\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0The systemic implications of that can prove scary.\nI read all the same material that you do about \"shrinking the banking system\" or \"decreasing leverage.\"\u00c2\u00a0 This paper makes you realize just how far we are from making those recommendations work.\nGorton's short paper is one of the best essays on the crisis so far.\u00c2\u00a0 Here are earlier posts on Gary Gorton and the crisis.\n", "title": "What happened in the shadow banking market?"}, {"index": 306, "text": "Compare:\n\n", "title": "Dominance Displays"}, {"index": 307, "text": "\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the Greek Finance Ministry had warned of \"complete collapse\" if the whole system\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6was not rethought\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\"Prices and value move in an atmosphere of imminent catastrophe,\" he wrote.\u00c2\u00a0 \"In Greece for a while now all the foundations of a healthy economy have been overturned.\u00c2\u00a0 There can be no stability, neither in economic equilibrium nor in monetary or financial affairs.\"\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6While the Italians\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6were genuinely worried by Greece's financial crisis, it was the Germans who needed to be persuaded.\u00c2\u00a0 Initially, Altenburg's advocacy of the Greek position was not well received even in his own Ministry.\u00c2\u00a0 But then the political stakes were suddenly raised\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6In Athens people expected the Finance Minister to win substantial concessions from the Germans.\u00c2\u00a0 In actual fact he was in a very weak position.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6It was not that the Greek financial crisis could be ignored;

In the model, expectations generate a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153felt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd health state which can mimic the medically cured health state even when the treatment in question has no real curing power. This effect may be augmented by self-limitation of the medical condition for which the treatment is utilized. A human agent then applies Bayes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rule to the felt history as if it were generated pharmacologically. A more sophisticated agent knows of placebo effects but does not know the precise extent to which they contribute to curing. I describe the bias that attends inference and the under \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or overutilization of therapies under such a model. A central result of the model is that human placebo learning is generally subject to greater bias in estimating treatment efficacy when diseases are self-limiting. Human agents may commit several types of decision errors under placebo learning.

As a result of the 1867 Compromise, Austria and Hungary shared a common currency, although they were fiscally sovereign and independent entities. By using repeated threats to quit, Hungary succeeded in obtaining more than proportional control and forcing the common central bank into a policy that was very favourable to it. Using insights from public economics, this paper explains the reasons for this outcome. Because Hungary would have been able to secure quite good conditions for itself had it broken apart, Austria had to provide its counterpart with incentives to stay on board. I conclude that the eventual split of Hungary after WWI was therefore not written on the wall in 1914, since the Austro-Hungarian monetary union was quite profitable to Hungarians.\n\nOther gated versions you'll find here.\u00c2\u00a0 The bottom line is that collapse of the currency union stemmed from political factors, not economics.\u00c2\u00a0 Contra the author, I would say it was written on the wall.\nI found this 1920 Economic Journal article, \"The Disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Currency,\"\u00c2\u00a0useful on the details of the transition.\u00c2\u00a0 The different parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire moved to different currencies by imposing capital controls and by stamping domestic currency to make it worth less.\u00c2\u00a0 That limits the bank run problem since moving into currency has no advantage and funds cannot be easily transferred in an advantageous manner.\u00c2\u00a0 Once all the money is stamped the currency has in effect been devalued.\nHere is a paper on the collapse of the ruble zone, though it doesn't have much on transition dynamics.\u00c2\u00a0 I suspect the transition is much easier\u00c2\u00a0in the absence of free capital movements.\nThere is a Peter Garber IMF Working Paper on the economics of the Austro-Hungarian\u00c2\u00a0dissolution\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c apparently not on-line \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which I am still trying to get my hands on.\u00c2\u00a0 Do any of you have a pdf?\u00c2\u00a0 At that previous link you'll find other references and links as well.\nAddendum: Matt Yglesias covers the former Czechslovakia.\n", "title": "How have previous currency unions dissolved?"}, {"index": 327, "text": NaN, "title": "Nicholas Kristof on toxins and autism"}, {"index": 328, "text": "I haven't been to Concepci\u00c3\u00b3n since December 1989, yet I will never forget my trip there.\u00c2\u00a0 It was the first time I learned what was for me to become an important truth.\u00c2\u00a0 If you set off to a mid-sized city in South America \u00e2\u20ac\u201d especially in the Southern Cone \u00e2\u20ac\u201d your chance of finding an idyllic\u00c2\u00a0spot are\u00c2\u00a0high.\u00c2\u00a0 There may be, in a way, nothing to do there, at least not in the sense that your guidebook can report.\u00c2\u00a0 But it will feel so fresh, so undiscovered, so representative of the\u00c2\u00a0vitality of everyday life, that you will at times think you have stumbled upon paradise.\u00c2\u00a0 Everyone there will seem so apart from the world you know and there is a sudden (and quite silly) shock at seeing how seriously they take the world they know.\u00c2\u00a0 Plus they have superb vanilla ice cream and strawberries for dessert.\nHere is the Cathedral, which was destroyed in 1939 by an earthquake.\n", "title": "Concepci\u00c3\u00b3n, Chile"}, {"index": 329, "text": "Matt Kahn has a good paper (and here) on this topic:\n\nUsing a new data set on annual deaths from disasters in 57 nations from 1980 to 2002, this paper tests several hypotheses concerning natural disaster mitigation.

They are 11.6 percent more likely to be scoring at grade level in sixth grade, 17.9 percent more likely to be scoring at grade level in seventh grade, and 27.5 percent more likely to be scoring at grade level by eighth grade. Overall, Promise Academy middle school enrollment appears to increase math scores by 1.2 standard deviations in eighth grade, more than the estimated benefits from reductions in class size, Teach for America, or Head Start.\n\nThese increases are very large and although supported by randomized experiment I wouldn't be surprised if future research cuts them down but if the true effect were even a quarter as large it would still be big news.\u00c2\u00a0 As Fryer told David Brooks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The results changed my life as a researcher because I am no longer interested in marginal changes.\"\nI don't know why anyone interested in the welfare of children would want to discourage this kind of experimentation. \n", "title": "Perkins versus Promise Academy Charter School"}, {"index": 378, "text": "\nThe percentage of faculty members receiving no salary increase this year is 21.2 percent, while 32.6 percent had their salaries reduced, with a median decrease (among those who saw a decrease) of 3 percent.\n\nHere is more information.\u00c2\u00a0 I see the overall trend as toward lower wages, with many cut-deserving people put at zero to shut them up.\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see how long they stay there.\n", "title": "Academic wage stickiness"}, {"index": 379, "text": "The author is Peter Hessler and the subtitle is A Journey Through China from Farm to Factory.\u00c2\u00a0 It is the account of the author's driving journeys throuh the Middle Kingdom.\u00c2\u00a0 Here is one bit:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Chinese drivers haven't grasped the subtleties of headlight use.\u00c2\u00a0 Most people keep their lights off until it's pitch-dark, and then they flip on the brights.\u00c2\u00a0 Almost nobody uses headlights in rain, fog, snow, or twilight conditions \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in fact, this is one of the few acts guaranteed to annoy a Chinese driver.\u00c2\u00a0 They don't mind if you tailgate, or pass on the right, or drive on the sidewalk.\u00c2\u00a0 You can back down a highway entrance ramp without anybody batting an eyelash.\u00c2\u00a0 But if you switch on your lights during a rainstorm, approaching drivers will invariably flash their brights in annoyance.\n\nI found this to be an excellent travel memoir, a very good book on transportation economics, a wonderful book on China, and most of all a first-rate study of the\u00c2\u00a0adjustments and changing norms which accompany rapid economic development.\u00c2\u00a0 I also found it to be a very funny book and, for whatever reason,\u00c2\u00a0I don't find most books funny.\u00c2\u00a0 \nHere is another bit on China:\n\nOften I passed billboards dedicated to the planned-birth policy, whose catchphrases ranged from tautology (\"Daughters Also Count as Descendants\") to unsolicited advice (\"Marry Late and Have Children Late\") to outright lies (\"Having a Son or a Daughter Is Exactly the Same\").\u00c2\u00a0 As I drove west, the messages became bigger, until barren hillsides were covered with slogans, as if words had swelled to fill the empty steppes, \"Everybody Work to Make the Green Mountain Greener\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201d this in forty-foot-tall characters across an Inner Mongolian mountain that was neither green nor the site of a single working person.\n\nRecommended.\n", "title": "*Country Driving*"}, {"index": 380, "text": "\nAfter Hurricane Ivan, the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) paid for the new $40\u00c2\u00a0million national stadium, and provided the aid of over 300 labourers to build and repair it.

Because the United States already has substantial private-sector capacity, and because many Americans are suspicious of government controls, the private route is the most likely option. Individuals would choose among competing providers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and those providers would try to offer the most appealing bundles of services, relative to cost. \nThe current tax exemption for health insurance benefits could be modified to encourage more cost-effective delivery systems, including forms of managed care that meet quality standards. For the elderly, the current Medicare fee-for-service method could be transformed into voucher programs for managed care treatment. Of course, people could go outside their network for additional services, if they were willing to pay. \nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not well advertised, but the Obama plan would move in this direction. Many people receiving new health insurance coverage would be enrolled in Medicaid, which already relies on managed care for about half of its patients. \nOn a national scale, effective managed care will require the right mix of reputation and regulation to enforce provider commitments, and will need some reframing and renaming to make it palatable. It could accurately be called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153competitive, choice-based single-payer coverage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6On the other hand, for reasons of perceived fairness, some people may be more willing to accept a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd answer on health care from a government agency than from a private company. If so, we run the risk of limiting our care choices just because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more squeamish about one kind of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than another.\n\nYou'll note that this is a proposal to come after the Obama plan (or whatever else we do), not in lieu of it.\u00c2\u00a0 It's not a competing idea but rather a recognition that rationing is coming in one form or another, even if some of the cost control proposals work.\nThere was not nearly enough space to deal with numerous points, including the following:\n1. What are the pluses and minuses of competitive managed care offers\u00c2\u00a0vs. government-run single-payer systems?\u00c2\u00a0 Or compare voucher-based competitive managed care \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for seniors \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to a much stronger\u00c2\u00a0Medicare advisory board.\u00c2\u00a0 Under the former scenario, individuals choose, upfront, which services won't be reimbursed.\u00c2\u00a0 Under the latter scenario, \"experts\" make that choice for everyone, subject to the constraints of politics.\u00c2\u00a0 Which will lead to better outcomes?\n2. I suspect the biggest problem with the voucher-based idea is when patients need to switch providers, say if they dissatisfied or if they are moving geographically.\u00c2\u00a0 To what extent would the required regulations here mimic some of what the Obama plan does to insurance companies?\u00c2\u00a0 Or could we just transfer how Medicaid handles managed care right now?\n3. If people do not trust their managed care providers, can we expect a mutual, cooperative, or non-profit form in those markets?\u00c2\u00a0 If so, how many of the advantages of markets over governments do we lose?\n4.

And since the Landsat imagery could well have been taken around the year 2000 (or even earlier), Richardson's image can reasonably be used to support the thesis that communal farmland is not as well managed as private land.\nWhat cannot be supported is the \"animation\" aspect which appears to show but in fact does not show a change over time. \u00c2\u00a0\nI should note that I have no reason to think that there was any\u00c2\u00a0malfeasance\u00c2\u00a0on the part of the Center for Global Development, a great organization, or Craig Richardson who originally brought attention to the photos. \u00c2\u00a0Indeed, my reading of Geens is that without some expert help it would be hard not to make some errors in interpreting Google images, which have a more complicated provenance than one would imagine. \u00c2\u00a0In addition, Richardson emailed me that he showed the images to farmers and government agriculture officials in Zimbabwe who agreed that they were representative of what was going on on the ground. \u00c2\u00a0(See also Geens on this point noting burning.) \u00c2\u00a0Nevertheless, although the redistribution of land in Zimbabwe clearly led to a drop in productivity and output, the animation is not evidence on this point.\nOne interesting point about this episode is that the story and the flash animation have been on the CGD website for several years but the huge exposure of MR means that we can draw on the expertise of many people around the world.

Almost all advanced countries.

This is the case with van Gogh, whose writing also shows how such interpretive attempts break down. Some of his letters are practical documents containing very little information, a series of bland platitudes to cajole, influence, and perhaps even mislead their readers. Tone and content contrast strikingly, from one recipient to the next. He himself stated\u00e2\u20ac\u201cif only in passing\u00e2\u20ac\u201cthat there is a lot wrong or exaggerated in his letters, \"without my always [sic] being aware of it\" (December 23, 1881).\nWhen van Gogh writes to his parents, he sounds like a normal son who is keen to reassure Mom and Dad that everything is OK; with his sister Willemien, he is loving, doting, and domestic, and it feels that he is trying not to remind her of his chaotic life, rather than trying to conceal it. He describes to her the prospect of sharing a room with Gauguin (July 31, 1888), calling him \"a very spirited painter.\" \"We'd live together for the sake of economy and for each other's company.\" A few months later (October 8 and 29), he writes to Theo that Gauguin needs to eat, walk in the countryside with him (Vincent), and \"have a screw once in a while\": \"He and I plan to go to the brothels a lot, but only to study them.\" The entire Gauguin story is a highlight of the volumes, and in those letters to Gauguin, not to mention to other artists, van Gogh is prickly, difficult, and condescending, playing the role of rival to the hilt.\nAs for his letters to Theo, these are so full of life that it's easy for the reader to assume that his brother is getting the \"real Vincent.\" But is he? Through much of this period, Theo is supporting van Gogh, either by sending him money, by selling his art (or trying to), or both. Writing to Theo, the artist comes across as whining, manipulative, and in careful control of the flow of information. It's a kind of faux frankness, maybe not untrue but designed to portray a mind in creative ferment and to fit a certain stereotype. There is often first a thanks for money received, a blizzard of reports about what van Gogh is doing and painting, and then at the end a suggestion that even more painting, activity, and creative ferment might be possible if only Theo would do everything to support him. Time and again, the reader wonders just how much van Gogh and his brother trust each other. In the letter of August 14, 1879, for instance, he complains that Theo has advised him to give up his quest to be an artist. \"And, joking apart, I honestly think it would be better if the relationship between us were more trusting on both sides,\" van Gogh suggests, before apologizing for the possibility that so much of the family sorrow and discord have been caused by him. These look and sound like letters to his brother, but in essence we are reading fund-raising proposals.\n\nYou have to register to read the whole review but it doesn't take long.\u00c2\u00a0 www.bookforum.com, by the way, is one of my all-time favorite web sites.\n", "title": "My review of the new edition of van Gogh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letters"}, {"index": 440, "text": "1.

Suppose that a researcher runs a regression and gets a coefficient on some variable of interest of 5.2 and a p value of .001. In explaining his or her results the researcher says \"a effect of this size would happen by chance alone only 0.1% of the time.\" \u00c2\u00a0Now that sounds very impressive but it is also misleading.\nIn economics and most of the social sciences what a p-value of .001 really means is that assuming everything else in the model is correctly specified the probability that such a result could have\u00c2\u00a0happened\u00c2\u00a0by chance is only 0.1%. \u00c2\u00a0It is easy to find a result that is statistically significant at the .001 level in one regression but not at all statistical significant in another regression with small changes such as the inclusion of an additional variable. \u00c2\u00a0Indeed, not only can statistical significance disappear, the variable can change size and even sign!\nA highly statistically significant result does not tell you that a result is robust. \u00c2\u00a0It is not even the case that more statistically significant results are more likely to be robust.\nNow go back to Siegfried's explanation for the p-value. \u00c2\u00a0Notice that he writes \"Correctly phrased, experimental data yielding a P value of .05\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" \u00c2\u00a0Almost everything of importance is buried in those words \"experimental data.\" \u00c2\u00a0In the social sciences we rarely have\u00c2\u00a0experimental data. \u00c2\u00a0Indeed, even \"experimental data\" is not quite right \u00e2\u20ac\u201c truly randomized\u00c2\u00a0data might be a better term because even so-called experimental data can involve attrition bias or other problems that make it less than truly random.\nThus, the problems with the p-value is not so much that people misinterpret it but rather that the conditions for the p-value to mean what people think it means are really quite restrictive and difficult to achieve.\nAddendum: Andew Gelman has a roundup of other comments on Siegfried's piece.\n\n", "title": "The Meaning of Statistical Significance"}, {"index": 458, "text": "\nThe Russians are not alone in pushing the idea that the next generation of nuclear reactors should have more in common with the small power plants on submarines than the sprawling installations of today. \n\nAnd this in particular:\n\nThe promise of miniature reactors powering homes, offices and schools is still years from being realized.

The study employs a panel data set on international chess with 1.4 million games recorded over a period of 11 years. The structure of the data set allows us to use individual fixed-effect estimations to control for aspects such as innate ability as well as other characteristics of the players. Most notably, the data contains an objective measure of individual playing strength, the so-called Elo rating. In line with previous research, we find that women are more risk-averse than men. A novel finding is that males choose more aggressive strategies when playing against female opponents even though such strategies reduce their winning probability.\n\nI am pleased to see that studying chess data is suddenly a \"trendy\" way to do behavioral economics.\u00c2\u00a0 Admittedly one is dealing with an unusual group of subjects.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet the quality of the data is high and the stakes are usually high too.\u00c2\u00a0 Computers can be used to judge the quality of moves.\n", "title": "Gender risk-aversion, using data from chess"}, {"index": 472, "text": "1.

Drawing on literature from political science and economics, this article argues that anti-bribery legislation, as presently enforced, functions as de facto economic sanctions. A detailed analysis of the history of FCPA enforcement shows that these sanctions have most often occurred in emerging markets, where historic opportunities for economic and social development otherwise exist and where public policy should encourage investment. This effect is contrary to the purpose of the FCPA which, as the legislative history shows, is to build economic and political alliances by promoting ethical overseas investment.\nThese perverse and unanticipated consequences create two policy problems. First, the sanctions literature suggests that the resulting foreign direct investment void may be filled by capital-rich countries that are not committed to effectively enforcing anti-bribery measures. This dynamic can be observed, for example, in China's aggressive investment in Africa, Latin America, and Central Asia, and creates myriad ethical, economic, and foreign policy problems. Second, by enforcing these laws without regard to their sanctioning effects, developed nations are unwittingly sacrificing poverty reduction opportunities to combat bribery. The paper concludes with various proposed reforms to the text and enforcement of international anti-bribery legislation that would further the goal of deterring bribery without deterring investment. \n\nHere is my previous post on the FCPA and Haiti.\n", "title": "FCPA as embargo"}, {"index": 477, "text": "I loved this book, which is written by Charles Emmerson.\u00c2\u00a0 Here is one short bit:\n\nDespite the prominence of the colors of Norway on Svalbard \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the firm insistence from any government representative that Svalbard is an integral part of the kingdom of Norway \u00e2\u20ac\u201d there are reminders that the archipelago is both something more and something less than that.\u00c2\u00a0 Russians and Ukrainians live here, some in Longyearbyen, though most are at the Russian settlement at Barentsburg.\u00c2\u00a0 The girls at the supermarket checkout counter speak Thai.\u00c2\u00a0 Somewhere in town is an Iranian who came here six years ago and, under the terms of the Spitsbergen Treaty, was able to settle here.\u00c2\u00a0 If he were to return south to the Norwegian mainland, he would almost definitely be forced to leave the country, his asylum claims having been refused.\u00c2\u00a0 Import duties are nonexistent on Svalbard: Cuban cigars cost less in Longyearbyen, at 78 degrees North, than they do in Oslo, three hours' flight to the south.\n\nHere is Wikipedia on Svalbard.\u00c2\u00a0 \nThis book covers\u00c2\u00a0why and how Greenland might become independent, what kind of presence in the Arctic Canada can realistically expect to have, the changing historical fortunes of Vladivostock, what the Law of the Sea really means, and why Norway manages its fossil fuel revenues so well, among other matters.\u00c2\u00a0 The Future History of the Arctic\u00c2\u00a0has fun and useful information on just about every page.\n \n", "title": "*The Future History of the Arctic*"}, {"index": 478, "text": "A few MR readers report having problems posting comments.\u00c2\u00a0 We will ask typepad to look into this, our apologies!\u00c2\u00a0 It should be fixed soon.\u00c2\u00a0 Is it possible to post comments on this post?\u00c2\u00a0 As an experiment, consider it an open forum on topics of your choice, politeness only as usual.\nAddendum: One report says typepad is down for comments from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m., EST, more or less.\n", "title": "Comment posting problem"}, {"index": 479, "text": "\n \n Hint: The woman on the right has not got hers on yet.\u00c2\u00a0 Hat tip Kottke.\n", "title": "Equality Shoes"}, {"index": 480, "text": "1.

This employer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual health-care costs are $750,000 (a hundred times $7,500). In the reformed system, the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers, if they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have insurance, would be eligible for generous subsidies to buy private insurance. For example, a married forty-year-old security guard whose wife stayed home to raise two kids could enroll in a non-group plan for less than $1,400 a year, according to the Kaiser Health Reform Subsidy Calculator. (The subsidy from the government would be $8,058.)\nIn a situation like this, the firm has a strong financial incentive to junk its group coverage and dump its workers onto the taxpayer-subsidized plan. Under the new law, firms with more than fifty workers that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer coverage would have to pay an annual fine of $2,000 for every worker they employ, excepting the first thirty. In this case, the security firm would incur a fine of $140,000 (seventy times two), but it would save $610,000 a year on health-care costs. If you owned this firm, what would you do? Unless you are unusually public spirited, you would take advantage of the free money that the government is giving out. Since your employees would see their own health-care contributions fall by more than $1,100 a year, or almost half, they would be unlikely to complain. And even if they did, you would be saving so much money you afford to buy their agreement with a pay raise of, say, $2,000 a year, and still come out well ahead.\n\nThis implies\u00c2\u00a0the current version of the plan won't work without stronger penalties.\u00c2\u00a0 In principle, I understand that it can be advantageous to dump many more people onto the exchanges, but not if so many of them end up getting such large subsidies.\u00c2\u00a0 Cassidy adds:\n\nEven if the government tried to impose additional sanctions on such firms, I doubt it would work. The dollar sums involved are so large that firms would try to game the system, by, for example, shutting down, reincorporating under a different name, and hiring back their employees without coverage. They might not even need to go to such lengths. Firms that pay modest wages have high rates of turnover. By simply refusing to offer coverage to new employees, they could pretty quickly convert most of their employees into non-covered workers.\n\nTypepad comments are still down (sorry!), but you can leave your comments here, sorry for the extra click which is required.\n", "title": "Is the mandate penalty large enough?"}, {"index": 499, "text": "Ofer Malamud and\nCristian Pop-Eleches look at the effects of a program that gave poor households a voucher to purchase a computer.\u00c2\u00a0 (The program was Romanian but the results may hold lessons for similar programs around the world.)\u00c2\u00a0 Households with incomes directly below a cutoff level were given a voucher while households with incomes directly above the cutoff were not.\u00c2\u00a0 Thus, households which were very similar were treated differently and this lets the authors use a regression discontinuity design that makes their results credible as representing a causal effect.\u00c2\u00a0 The results of a regression discontinuity design are also very easy to explain with figures.\u00c2\u00a0 \nThe income cutoff is shown by the red line.\u00c2\u00a0 Beginning at the top left we see that households with incomes just below the cutoff were much more likely to have a computer than households with incomes just above the cutoff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thus the voucher program has a big effect on computer ownership.\u00c2\u00a0 The top right figure shows similarly that the voucher program increased computer usage since computers were used much more often in households with incomes just below the cutoff than in the non-eligible-for-voucher households with incomes just above the cutoff.\u00c2\u00a0 \n\nNow take at look at the figures below.\u00c2\u00a0 The one on the left shows that the voucher program significantly increased the time spent playing computer games.\u00c2\u00a0 The one on the right which looks at the effect of the voucher program on the use of computers for homework \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well, the punch line is clear.\u00c2\u00a0 \n\u00c2\u00a0\nNot surprisingly, with all that game playing going on, the authors find that the voucher program actually resulted in a decline in grades although there was also some evidence for an increase in computer proficiency and perhaps some improvement in a cognitive test.\nHat tip to David Youngberg at the SeetheInvisibleHand.\n", "title": "One Game Machine Per Child"}, {"index": 500, "text": "Chug relates to me that he saw the following, plastered on the side of a Metro bus:\n\nIf we don't know how many people there areHow will we know how many buses we need?\n\nIf you have a photo, please send it along.\n", "title": "A Census ad on a Metro bus, socialist calculation debate edition"}, {"index": 501, "text": "Someone from Netflix writes to me:\n\nThe post office doesn't scan any DVDs for us.

If liability on a firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\ncontingent debt is especially likely to be triggered when the firm is insolvent, the\ncontract that creates the debt transfers wealth from the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors to its\nshareholders. A firm therefore has incentive to engage in correlation-seeking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is,\nto incur contingent debts that correlate, or that through asset purchases can be made to\ncorrelate, with the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insolvency risk. The consequence is an overuse of contingent\ndebt that destroys social wealth through overinvestment, higher borrowing costs,\nfinancial distress, and potential systemic risk. Correlation-seeking is especially\npernicious because, unlike other forms of shareholder opportunism such as asset\nsubstitution, it can reduce risk to shareholders even as it increases shareholder returns. \n\nIt's long been known that a firm close to bankruptcy has an\nincentive to gamble because if the gamble pays off the\nshareholders prosper and if the gamble fails then the shareholders are no worse off (since the firm was already close to bankruptcy).\u00c2\u00a0\nBut gambles like this\nadd to shareholder value primarily by transferring wealth from\nthe creditors who bear the downside risk without any hope of upside gain. \n\n\nSquire shows how this idea is magnified when we add\ncontingent debt and correlated asset returns.\u00c2\u00a0 A contingent debt is one that must\nbe paid only in certain states.\u00c2\u00a0 If the shareholders take on\ncontingent debt and at the same time buy assets with low or negative\npayoffs in the same set of states then the shareholders can focus the downside risk into the states in which they are bankrupt anyway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thus focusing the downside risk onto unsecured creditors.\u00c2\u00a0 \nCorrelation seeking of this kind becomes easier with contingent\nsecurities and more difficult to monitor.\u00c2\u00a0 As Squire points out even as AIG was writing credit default\nswaps (a type of contingent debt) on MBS it was buying MBS for its own portfolio and of course the ultimate unsecured creditors, the taxpayers, paid the price.\u00c2\u00a0 \n", "title": "Correlation-Seeking"}, {"index": 548, "text": "I very much enjoyed reading this now-dated (1989) but still insightful volume of country-specific essays by Hans Magnus Enzensberger,\u00c2\u00a0one of Germany's leading public intellectuals.\u00c2\u00a0 The chapter on Sweden was my favorite.\u00c2\u00a0 Here is one good bit:\n\nThe \"motley feudal ties\" to which Marx alludes in the Communist Manifesto were torn asunder here earlier than anywhere else, to be replaced by a strictly organized centralized state.\u00c2\u00a0 Oxenstierna, an administrative genius, invented the prefectorial system two hundred years before Napoleon.\u00c2\u00a0 He sent governors armed with executive powers into all the regions of the kingdom.\u00c2\u00a0 They even had military means at their disposal to enforce the king's policies against the interests of the provinces.\u00c2\u00a0 He created the first national atlas and the first central bank in the world.\u00c2\u00a0 And so on.\u00c2\u00a0 Does all this have no implications for the present condition of the country and for the problems of its institutions?\n\nEnzensberger\u00c2\u00a0also refers to Sweden as a country which has liquidated its own history in a bout of extreme forgetfulness.\u00c2\u00a0 I also liked this bit on Italy:\n\nThe great strength of this system is that it works not only from the top down but also from the bottom up \u00e2\u20ac\u201d because even the poor, the \"underprivileged,\" have their privileges, their consolations, and prerogatives.\u00c2\u00a0 The concierge apportions his favors and his punishments as he pleases, and the doorkeeper enjoys a mysterious power, of which his boss, the minister, is quite ignorant.\n\nYou can buy the book here.\n", "title": "*Europe, Europe: Forays into a Continent*"}, {"index": 549, "text": "\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6because trade accounts for only a third of the economy, compared with a Latin American average of about half, Colombia has been sheltered from the worst of the global slowdown.

To institutional investors, ranging from pension funds to insurance companies, fixed income investments appear disproportionately attractive in this environment, driving long-term interest rates low. Consequently, mortgage rates drop, making equity investment in housing attractive for homeowners. Even in the absence of a well-functional mortgage market (common in other countries that also had a significant housing boom) equity investment in housing appears to have the characteristics of a fixed-income investment, which again appears attractive in the absence of high ROE investments elsewhere. All of this boosts housing prices significantly above cost, which creates apparent arbitrage opportunities for the homebuilding industry and related industries (mortgage, finance, materials, machinery, etc). This temporarily cushions the blow to the economy of not having high ROE investment opportunities, by becoming the high ROE investment opportunity itself. But since the demand for housing is driven by miscalculation to start with (lower long-term interest rates driven by lower expected economic growth should not lead to an increase in real estate prices, except to the extent that the underlying real estate itself represents a bottleneck to growth), those high ROE investment opportunities turn out to have been illusory and cause significant losses for whoever in the supply chain is stuck with the excess inventory. The growth in supply of housing uncovers the illusion and the resulting price volatility causes a credit crisis and a severe economic downturn, as the economy faces both the temporary shock of price volatility and the long term shock of lack of high ROE investment opportunities.\nAnd what explains the lack of high ROE investment opportunities in the first place? There are many places to look, but the biggest is the supply bottleneck in energy. While the growth in information technology has been impressive, as is the consequent potential for increase in productivity, none of this can increase return on capital against the backdrop of energy supply bottleneck. This is hard to explain, though my posts in the following thread effectively discuss the logic behind why energy scarcity will lead to low long term interest rates and low growth, not high energy prices:\nhttp://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/11\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6regime-397397/\n\nI don't know who wrote that, but I thank a loyal MR reader for pointing it out to me.\u00c2\u00a0 Here is related data on MPK.\n", "title": "Real theories of the financial crisis"}, {"index": 581, "text": "\nFor every doctor, there are five people performing health care administrative support.\n\nThat's from Catherine Rampell.\n", "title": "Sentences to ponder"}, {"index": 582, "text": "For all the complaints you hear, internet reading\u00c2\u00a0is much less segregated than the networks of our work, family, and friends (all given formal measurements\u00c2\u00a0in the paper).\u00c2\u00a0 Jesse Shapiro and Matt Gentzkow report:\n\nWe use individual and aggregate data to ask how the Internet is changing the ideological segregation of the American electorate.

presided over Christ's crucivixion should become a Confessor of the Church, to be celebrated in their sacred art and given a feast day in June and a star place in the liturgy at Epiphany, the greatest

theories of negative liberty \u00e2\u20ac\u201d purely libertarian\u00c2\u00a0theories where only negative liberty seems to matter \u00e2\u20ac\u201d require standards for degrees of coercion.\u00c2\u00a0 Those standards will very often depend on how much wealth the victims of the coercion have\u00c2\u00a0and they will depend on a more general concept of positive liberty.\u00c2\u00a0 Negative liberty standards can't help but seep into a concern with consequences.\nFast forward to said debate.\u00c2\u00a0 When people are poor, apparently small interventions can be quite crushing and quite coercive.\u00c2\u00a0 To cite the \"smaller\" interventions of 1880 doesn't much convince me.\u00c2\u00a0 The real impact of the depredations against women was very, very large, even from some \"small interventions\" (and I don't think they were all small).\n(Also, I would not in this case take the *legal* oppressions to be\u00c2\u00a0a stand-alone or\u00c2\u00a0exogenous\u00c2\u00a0variable, separable from more general societal attitudes.\u00c2\u00a0 There were various male desires\u00c2\u00a0to oppress women, which took a mix of legal and non-legal forms.\u00c2\u00a0 Asking how bad the \"government-only\" restrictions were is an odd division of the problem, since the governmental and non-governmental restrictions were an integrated package which worked together in non-linear fashion.)\nEvery negative liberty theorist is a positive liberty theorist in disguise and this comes out once they start citing degress of outrage, degrees of harm, degrees of coercion,\u00c2\u00a0and the like.\nI suppose my views are close to those of Will.\u00c2\u00a0 I also largely agree with Dave Schmidtz and Jason Brennan in their symposium at Cato

Using school fixed effects, we estimate the impact of introducing a new ITES center in the vicinity of the school on enrollment. We find that introducing a new ITES center results in a 5.7% increase in number of children enrolled; these effects are extremely localized. We argue this result is not driven by pre-trends in enrollment or endogenous center placement, and is not a result of ITES-center induced changes in population or increases in income.

The Liberal Party, headed by Jean Chr\u00c3\u00a9tien as prime minister and Paul Martin as finance minister, led most of this shift. Prompted by the financial debacle in Mexico, Canadian leaders had the courage and the foresight to make those spending cuts before a fiscal crisis was upon them.

But Canada remained a highly humane society, and American liberals continue to cite it as a beacon of progressive values. \nCounterintuitively, the relatively strong Canadian trust in government may have paved the way for government spending cuts, a pattern that also appears in Scandinavia. Citizens were told by their government leadership that such cuts were necessary and, to some extent, they trusted the messenger. \nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less obvious that the United States can head down the same path, partly because many Americans are so cynical about policy makers. In many ways, this cynicism may be justified, but it is not always helpful, as it lowers trust and impedes useful social bargains. \nForces like the Tea Party movement argue for fiscal conservatism, though it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t obvious that they are creating the conditions for success. Over the last year, we have been treated to the spectacle of conservatives defending Medicare against proposed cuts, in large part to curry favor with voters and mobilize sentiment against the Democratic health care plan. \n\nThe column also offers up some general reasons for considering spending cuts and not just tax increases.\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe Arnold Kling won't like this column, but when I look around the globe for episodes of successful spending restraint I see Canada, Finland, Sweden, and now possibly (probably) Ireland, which is in the midst of fiscal restructuring.\u00c2\u00a0 I see change coming from elites and I see relatively left-wing governments (Ireland, admittedly, is harder to classify) which are trusted by their citizens.\u00c2\u00a0 The Greek government, in contrast, doesn't operate with the same level of social cohesion and thus it is likely to fail.\nI believe the \"social trust\" scenario for spending cuts is overlooked because it raises the relative status of groups which people who favor spending cuts do not wish to raise.\nI wouldn't want to force the view that the United States will or can follow the path of these other nations.\u00c2\u00a0 But when there is no other evidence, look to the path of what has been shown to be possible.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0This is a neglected point in the debate on fiscal restructuring and it suggests we are not currently on a propitious path.\u00c2\u00a0 Right now many fiscal conservatives are looking to voter outrage to drive change and I'm just not sure there is a \"there there.\"\u00c2\u00a0 Here's one good post on how much conservatives like government spending.\nThe Timothy Lewis book, by the way, deserves far more attention than it has received.\u00c2\u00a0 Note that the earlier sections of the book are somewhat boring but it picks up in the later parts.\nAddendum: Arnold Kling comments.\n", "title": "The public choice economics of spending cuts"}, {"index": 609, "text": "1.

I'd like to air a skeptical note and ask whether they're really running the show.\nTo most people these days \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether on the left or the right \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such a question smacks of insanity or deliberate stupidity. It barely seems worth addressing.\nHave we not observed hundreds of billions in bailouts, up to three decades of lax regulation, massive and unjust CEO bonuses, and now the near-immediate return of record bank profitability? Are not many of the Republicans serving up knee-jerk opposition to virtually any kind of meaningful financial reform, perhaps because they receive campaign contributions from banks? On the surface, banks seem to be a nearly invulnerable interest group in American politics.\nYet this last week's SEC civil lawsuit against Goldman Sachs, which caused a thirteen percent decline in the company's stock in one day, should serve a cautionary note. Of all the big banks, Goldman is supposed to be the strongest and most politically connected. It remains to be seen how the charges will proceed, but at the very least it is odd that the Masters of the Universe would have let it come to this at all.\nThe context for this question is the \"public choice\" analysis in Simon Johnson's and James Kwak's enlightening new bestseller 13 Bankers. Johnson and Kwak make a major step forward in describing our recent financial crisis as a fundamental problem in political economy, namely by pointing their fingers at an unholy alliance between banks and the U.S. government. Much as I admire their analysis and exposition, I see the problem a bit differently than they do. Whereas they see banks as the puppet master and our government as the fool, I wonder whether it is not more accurate to think of the government as running the show.\nPerhaps the strongest piece of evidence for the financial sector dominance of U.S. political economy is the recent bailouts. Yet it's instructive to ask which other groups have received bailouts in the last fifteen years. The list would include Mexico and the numerous countries which have borrowed from the largely U.S.-created International Monetary Fund, such as Indonesia. They are hardly dominant forces of influence in Washington. It was China who made out like a bandit from the bailout of the mortgage agencies, and the validation of their debt issues, but again the Chinese are not in charge.\nThere's a different way to think about the bailouts, namely that the U.S. government stands at the center of a giant nexus of money raising, most of all to finance the U.S. government budget deficit and keep the whole show up and running. The perception at least is that our country requires the dollar as a reserve currency, requires New York City as a major banking center with major banks, and requires fully credible governmental guarantees behind every Treasury auction and requires liquid financial markets more generally. Furthermore the international trade presence of the United States (supposedly) requires the federal government to strongly ally with major commercial interests, just as our government sides with Hollywood in trade and intellectual property disputes. To abandon banks is to send a broader message that we are in commercial and political decline and disarray, and that is hardly an acceptable way to proceed, at least not according to the standards of the real Washington consensus.\nIn other words, it's our government deciding to assemble a cooperative ruling coalition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which includes banks \u00e2\u20ac\u201d at the heart of its fiscal core. It's our government deciding who belongs to this coalition and who does not, mostly for reasons of political expediency and also a perception \u00e2\u20ac\u201c correct or not \u00e2\u20ac\u201d of what is best for the welfare of American voters. If we don't in this year \"get tough\" with banking regulation, it's because our government itself doesn't want to, not because of some stubborn recalcitrant Republicans.\nAsk yourself the simple question: who has both the guns and the money, including the ability to print new money at zero cost? It's Washington, not the private banks.\nIf we look back at the broader stretch of American history, banks are by no means a dominant interest group. They arouse massive suspicion in the Jacksonian era, they are left to rot in the 1930s, they are forbid branching rights for many decades, and they end up as a decentralized sector for most of the postwar era. It's not clear why the fundamental equation of power should suddenly have changed so dramatically in recent times and perhaps it hasn't.\nThis analysis bears on one of the main policy recommendations of Johnson and Kwak, namely to break up the big banks so they cannot soil Washington with such powerful lobbying and privileges. I believe this recommendation will not achieve its stated ends and that Washington would find another way to assemble privileged financial institutions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no matter what their exact form \u00e2\u20ac\u201d within its ruling coalition. Breaking up the large banks would be striking at symptoms rather than at root causes, namely the ongoing growth of political power and the reliance of that power upon an ongoing inflow of capital. \nIf you do wish to break or limit the power of the major banks, running a balanced budget is probably the most important step we could take. It would mean that our government no longer needs to worry so much about financing its activities. Of course such an outcome is distant these days, mostly because American voters love both high government spending and relatively low taxes. \nI commend Johnson and Kwak for their excellent work, but I also conclude that the problems of banking reform are harder than we usually like to think.\n", "title": "Do big banks control our government?

In Texas it's beef, in the Carolinas it's pork, and in Western Kentucky it's mutton. Thanks to the tariff of 1816, wool production in the then Western United States became profitable and suddenly people found themselves with a lot of sheep on their hands. \nAny story of the origin of barbecue starts with a meat that is too tough and undesirable to be sold for a profit. Mutton barbecue is no different. Aging sheep who no longer produced good wool became a virtually unlimited resource, but the meat was too tough and too strong tasting to be worth anything so people turned to the tried and true methods of low and slow cooking. In the early days a whole sheep would be cooked for long hours over a low fire. A mixture of salt water would be mopped over it and it would be served up with a dipping sauce of vinegar and hot peppers and stuck between a couple slices of bread. In Kentucky this \"sauce\" is called a dip, specifically Mutton Dip or Vinegar Dip. \n\nCall it the Protectionist Theory of Barbecue, plus or minus a bit of hysteresis.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0I've\u00c2\u00a0seen or heard of mutton barbecue only in Kentucky and then only parts of Kentucky, the southwest and a bit in Lexington.\u00c2\u00a0 I wonder if they have mutton barbecue in North Africa or the Middle East.\u00c2\u00a0 In general it is\u00c2\u00a0an open\u00c2\u00a0question\u00c2\u00a0why barbecue traditions have for so long been so geographically concentrated.\nFrom The New Yorker, here is another account:\n\nHow come this is the only area where mutton is barbecued?\" I asked an Owensboro merchant who had been kind enough to give me change for a nickel parking meter.\n\"I expect because there are so many Catholics here,\" he said.\nI didn't want to appear ignorant. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"I suppose that'd do it.\"\nAs I was searching my mind for some connection between the Roman rite and mutton consumption, the merchant told me that the large Catholic churches in town have always staged huge picnics that feature barbecue and burgoo\u00e2\u20ac\u201cburgoo, another staple of Owensboro barbecue restaurants, being a soupy stew that I, for some reason, had always associated with southern Illinois. In the early days, the church picnics apparently served barbecued goat. In fact, Owensboro might have arrived at barbecued mutton by a process of elimination, since people in the area seem willing to barbecue just about any extant mammal. In western Kentucky, barbecue restaurants normally do \"custom cooking\" for patrons who have the meat but not the pit, and among the animals that Posh & Pat's offers to barbecue is raccoon. The Shady Rest, one of the most distinguished barbecue joints in Owensboro, has a sign that says \"If It Will Fit on the Pit, We Will Barbecue It. It is probably fortunate that the people of the area settled on barbecued mutton as the local delicacy before they had a go at beaver or polecat\n\nIn other words, they don't know either.\u00c2\u00a0 What would Robin Hanson say?: Something like: \"Food isn't about eating!\" \nI thank Brandon Sheridan for the pointers.\n", "title": "The origins of mutton barbecue"}, {"index": 660, "text": "\nAfter nine years of regulatory review, the federal government gave the green light Wednesday to the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first offshore wind farm, a highly contested project off the coast of Cape Cod. \n\nThe full article is here.\u00c2\u00a0 But wait, whoops!, I left out one part:\n\nSeveral regulatory hurdles remain, and opponents of the wind farm have vowed to go to court, potentially stalling Cape Wind for several more years. \n\n", "title": "Why carbon tax proponents should talk more about deregulation"}, {"index": 661, "text": "\nPortugal is still slotted to loan money to Greece at a rate very far below its own borrowing costs!\n\nThat's from Angus, who also suggests that the Greeks sell their part of Cyprus to Turkey.\n", "title": "Sentences to ponder"}, {"index": 662, "text": "1.

If the box is not checked, it is presumed the person wants to donate. \n\nThe first thing to note about this proposal is that contrary to what Brodsky suggests, the problem isn't families who refuse to follow the wishes of the potential donor\u00e2\u20ac\u201cas a rule, families who know, follow.\u00c2\u00a0 The problem is that families often don't know what their loves ones would have wanted because many people don't sign their organ donor cards.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nIn fact, the way presumed consent actually works is not by overriding the wishes of the family it's by making the wishes of the potential donor more clearly known to her family.\u00c2\u00a0 In most presumed consent countries the family still has the ultimate say in practice because what doctor is going to want to go against the wishes of the family in a time of grief?\u00c2\u00a0 Instead, presumed consent increases the probability that families say yes by changing their background information from my loved one didn't opt-in to my loved one didn't opt-out.\u00c2\u00a0 \n So under presumed consent we get more families saying yes\u00e2\u20ac\u201cbut not all\u00e2\u20ac\u201cand there are other constraints such as the number of people who die in a way that makes their organs available for transplant and the availability of transplant surgeons and facilities to do the operation and so forth.\nIn a roundtable on this issue with Sally Satel, Art Kaplan and others, Kieran Hiely notes:\nSpain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success is due to effective management of the transplant\nsystem, not a simple legal rule. Similarly, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s donation rate grew\nrapidly in the 1990s thanks to investment in its system, not because of\nits long-standing presumed consent law. Some countries, notably\nAustria, do have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153true\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd presumed consent, with no kin veto. But they do\nnot outperform countries like the U.S. by any great margin.\n\nI'm actually a bit more positive than Kieran, the\u00c2\u00a0best evidence\u00c2\u00a0is that presumed consent raises donation rates by perhaps 20-30%.\u00c2\u00a0 Not bad, but not enough to eliminate the shortage. \u00c2\u00a0To do that, as Satel notes in her contribution to the roundtable it will take live donation.\nKieran also writes:\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth remembering that, since the 1970s, the U.S.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153transplant community\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has worked hard to allay public concerns that\nsurgeons might be too eager to harvest organs, or that the state might\nplay too calculating a role in deciding what happens to the bodies of\npotential donors. \n\nThe latter point is especially important in the United States.\u00c2\u00a0 Brazil, for example, switched to presumed consent and then switched back to opt-in when people became fearful and outraged and donation rates fell.\u00c2\u00a0 It's not hard to imagine similar blowback in the United States.\n\nIt's also worth remembering that considered as a whole the U.S. system is the best in the world.\u00c2\u00a0 Spain does have a very high rate of deceased donation, but it does poorly on live donation.\u00c2\u00a0 Iran leads the world on live donation because it compensates donors but due to religious feelings about the sacredness of the body Iran, like other Muslim countries, does poorly on deceased donation.\u00c2\u00a0 The US does well on both deceased and live donation and in total leads the world.\nWe can do better but we do need to tread carefully.\n\n \n", "title": "Presumed Consent and Organ Donation"}, {"index": 700, "text": "Here is Esther Duflo, this year's\nJohn Bates Clark medal winner, giving an overview of her work on using randomized trials to evaluate development policies. \nHat tip to Shruti Rajagopolan.\n\n", "title": "Esther Duflo at TED"}, {"index": 701, "text": "This one is from the new\u00c2\u00a0blog, Constructive Economics, written by Abraham Othman.\u00c2\u00a0 The premise of the post is to imagine a hedge fund devoted to altruism \u00e2\u20ac\u201d not profits \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and ask how the fund could operate most effectively:\n\n\nIt would attempt to move market prices as much as possible.

A charitable hedge fund would instead run the same optimization in reverse, trying to push the price as close to x as possible.\n\n\nIt would be an activist fund with a focus on jobs, or the environment, or some other charitable cause, instead of profits (or the lack thereof caused by managerial incompetence).\n\n\nIt would be selective about the short positions it takes. Inasmuch as market prices can be self-fulfilling prophecies (and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to write more about this idea at some point), the fund would use this power selectively, to reward the good and punish the evil.

These policies reflected two aspects of the political and economic system of that period. First, they reflected the political priorities of the newly elected government, which was elected under a promise to the public for a radical change in the socioeconomic system. The expansion of the welfare state in the late 1970s had increased the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appetite for additional state transfers and for further measures to lower the gap between low- and high-income groups in the society. Second, they reflected the lack of any constraint, internal or external, in the conduct of economic policy. The debt-to-GDP ratio in 1981 was only 34.5%, despite the fiscal expansion that took place during that year. The debt-to-GDP ratio was the highest of the previous 30 years, but still at a relatively low level by world standards. Thus, the Greek government did not face any difficulties borrowing from the domestic and international markets in the early 1980s. This allowed the government to continue pursuing its expansionary policies. Moreover, the central bank lacked independence, a factor that Alesina (1988) and Cukierman, et. al., (1992) find to be inversely related to inflation. Even though the Currency Committee was officially abolished in 1982, the government continued to set the broad outlines of monetary and exchange rate policies during the 1980s. This meant that monetary policy was dominated by the need to finance fiscal expansion. \n\nAlthough I still favor Greece leaving the Eurozone, we should remember they joined the currency union for a plausible reason, namely that\u00c2\u00a0their own monetary policy was a disaster in the making.\u00c2\u00a0 Here's a very good post on how deeply structural the Greek problems run.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n\n", "title": "Where Greece went wrong"}, {"index": 710, "text": "\nIncreasing automation and competition have reduced the Big Board and Nasdaq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volume in securities they list from as much as 80 percent in the last decade.

In principle they could make more money with higher prices, but then they'd risk not selling out, and empty seats would quickly wipe out any revenue gains from raised prices, not to mention harming that elusive 'buzz'. In practice such restaurants generally wind up leaving some money on the table, no pun intended, and take the stability of always selling out over the potential of higher revenues.\nI've come up with a variant on dutch auctions which solves this problem quite beautifully. The restaurant continues to charge the same amounts it does currently, with the same menu, but there's a 'seating fee' for sitting down which might be charged if the restaurant sells out in advance. The amount of the seating fee is determined by when the restaurant becomes completely booked, with the fee going down the later the selling out happens, possibly going down to zero at the end. By making a reservation when the potential seating fee is a certain amount, a customer is declaring that they're willing to pay the seating fee for that time period if it is necessary, but they aren't penalized for making an early reservation unless it would have been necessary to do an early reservation to get a seat. By waiting to make a reservation until later, a customer is declaring that they are unwilling to pay a higher price, but also allowing for the possibility that the restaurant will become fully booked and they won't get a seat. One of the nice features of this system is that the reservation system is essentially unchanged, allowing for trivial support of reserving particular time slots and tables.\nThis system also works for concerts and other events which have the potential to sell out.\n\n", "title": "Bram Cohen on restaurant reservations"}, {"index": 715, "text": "\n\"You do not propose to a woman without absolute assurance that she'll say yes,\" says Ethan, and Mr. Brentan agrees.\nThere is broader context:\nIn 1972, on a park bench in Birmingham, Ala., Garner Lee Green's father proposed to her mother.

Theory has shown that this could yield a profitable price discrimination strategy often termed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153metering.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The idea is that a customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intensity of demand for aftermarket goods (e.g. the concessions) provides a meter of how much the customer is willing to pay for the primary good (e.g. admission). If this correlation in tastes for the two goods is positive, a high price on the aftermarket good allows firms to extract a greater total price (admissions plus concessions) from higher type customers. This paper develops a simple aggregate model of discrete-continuous demand to motivate how this correlation can be tested using simple regression techniques and readily available firm data. Model simulations illustrate that the regressions can be used to predict whether aftermarket prices should be above, below or equal to their marginal cost. We then apply the approach to box-office and concession data from a chain of Spanish theaters and find that high priced concessions do extract more surplus from customers with a greater willingness to pay for the admission ticket.\n\nIn other words, price discrimination is one (not the only) plausible rationale for why popcorn is so expensive at the movie theater, relative to marginal cost.\u00c2\u00a0 For other MR posts, on this problem, type \"popcorn\" into the MR search box on the left hand side of the page.\n", "title": "The popcorn puzzle, an empirical investigation"}, {"index": 725, "text": "1.

Coinciding with this growth in prescription drug expenditures has been a rapid rise in direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA), made feasible by the Food and Drug Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (FDA) clarification and relaxation of the rules governing broadcast advertising in 1997 and 1999. This study investigates the separate effects of broadcast and non-broadcast DTCA on price and demand, utilizing an extended time series of monthly records for all advertised and non-advertised drugs in four major therapeutic classes spanning 1994-2005, a period which enveloped the shifts in FDA guidelines and the large expansions in DTCA. Controlling for promotion aimed at physicians, results from fixed effects models suggest that broadcast DTCA positively impacts own-sales and price, with an estimated elasticity of 0.10 and 0.04 respectively. Relative to broadcast DTCA, non-broadcast DTCA has a smaller impact on sales (elasticity of 0.05) and price (elasticity of 0.02). Simulations suggest that the expansion in broadcast DTCA may be responsible for about 19 percent of the overall growth in prescription drug expenditures over the sample period, with over two-thirds of this impact being driven by an increase in demand as a result of the DTCA expansion and the remainder due to higher prices.\n\nThe paper is here\u00c2\u00a0(NBER gate).\u00c2\u00a0 Here is a simpler paper on advertising and prescription drug expenditures.\u00c2\u00a0 Here is a related paper on the advertising topic. \u00c2\u00a0Here is another paper which generates higher prices from advertising.\u00c2\u00a0 Pharmaceuticals could be different from eyeglasses for a few reasons, one being weaker contestability in the market, due to patent protection, another being that consumers process information about health care differently.\u00c2\u00a0 This paper suggests that co-payments don't much help reduce inappropriate demands for pharmaceuticals.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\nI thank Eric John Barker for the initial pointer.\n", "title": "Advertising and pharmaceutical prices"}, {"index": 766, "text": "This\u00c2\u00a0LRB article by Jeremy Harding articulates\u00c2\u00a0an increasing fear that food markets will not operate smoothly over the next decade or two.\u00c2\u00a0 He gives some\u00c2\u00a0major reasons (only partially reproduced here) to be pessimistic:\n\nThe first is the nature and extent of population growth: we are six billion now and by 2030 we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be eight billion\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nThe second is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe nutrition transition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: generations that once lived on grains, pulses and legumes have been replaced by more prosperous people with a taste for meat and dairy. Crops like maize which once fed many of us directly now feed fewer of us indirectly, via a costly diversion from which they emerge in the value-added form of meat. Global production of food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will have to increase by 50 per cent over the next 20 years to cater for two billion extra people and cope with the rising demand for meat.\nThe third factor is energy: the industrial production of food is sure to become more expensive as fuel costs rise. It takes 160 litres of oil to produce a tonne of maize in the US; natural gas accounts for at least three-quarters of the cost of making nitrogen fertiliser; freight, too, depends on fuel.\nLand is the fourth. The amount of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s land given over to agriculture continues to grow (in the UK, roughly 70 per cent of land is agricultural), but in per capita terms it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shrinking. As with oil, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible to envisage \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpeak food\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (the point of maximum production, followed by decline), \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpeak phosphorus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, i.e. the high point in the use of phosphate fertiliser (one estimate puts it at 2035), and, as the FAO suggests in its diplomatic way, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpeak land\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: the point at which the total area of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most productive land begins to diminish (soil exhaustion, climate change) and marginal land comes up for reassessment.\n[Fifth] Alternative fuels are reducing the amount of land available for growing food. \n\nThe Julian Simon-savvy crowd that reads MR might not be so impressed, but I wouldn't write off these worries so quickly.\u00c2\u00a0 On the list, #1 and #2 do not impress me per se, but they do\u00c2\u00a0require that market mechanisms of adjustment be allowed to operate.\u00c2\u00a0 Note that\u00c2\u00a0agriculture and land markets are highly regulated around the world and that you don't have to read this as a story of market failure.\u00c2\u00a0 As for #3, most energy is mispriced today.\u00c2\u00a0 Keeping it cheap means growing pressure on that externality, while taxing it means a solid whack to a lot of food markets.\u00c2\u00a0 #5 stems from bad government policies.\u00c2\u00a0 Another problem, mentioned later by Harding,\u00c2\u00a0is that very often water for agriculture is subsidized and\u00c2\u00a0unsustainably so.\u00c2\u00a0 Keeping water cheap means growing pressure on that externality, while removing the subsidies (which I favor) means a solid whack to a lot of food markets, at least in the short run.\u00c2\u00a0 The world as a whole is consuming its capital of aquifers and the like and engaging in\u00c2\u00a0short-term thinking by refusing to let the price of water rise as it ought to.\u00c2\u00a0 Internalizing all the relevant externalities, and increasing sustainable long-run production, would in fact mean big \"tax\" hikes on growing food today.\nThere is also a critical scale at which fertilizer run-off and erosion externalities start to matter at a level beyond which we are accustomed to seeing.\nI believe these factors mean a stronger case for agricultural free trade, rather than \"localism,\" yet at the same time removing the subsidies for sprawl.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet so far the people worried most about these issues are often the ones with the least economically informed answers.\u00c2\u00a0 It would be a

Sullivan were a Lacanian and a Hegelian:\n\nEarlier generations of women politicians (Golda Meir, Indira Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, up to a point even Hillary Clinton) were what is usually referred to as \"phallic\" women: they acted as \"iron ladies\" who imitated and tried to outdo male authority, to be \"more men than men themselves.\"\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Jacques-Alain Miller pointed out how Sarah Palin, on the contrary, proudly displays her femininity and motherhood.\u00c2\u00a0 She has a \"castrating\" effect on her male opponents not by way of being more manly than them, but by using the ultimate feminine weapon, the sarcastic put-down of male authority \u00e2\u20ac\u201d she knows that male \"phallic\" authority is a posture, a semblance to be exploited and mocked.\u00c2\u00a0 Recall how she mocked Obama as a \"community organizer,\" exploiting the fact that there was something sterile in Obama's physical appearance, with his diluted black skin, slender features, and big ears.\u00c2\u00a0 Here we have \"post-feminist\" femininity without a complex, uniting the features of mother, prim teacher (glasses, hair in a bun), public person, and, implicitly, sex object, proudly displaying the \"first dude\" as a phallic toy.\u00c2\u00a0 The message is that she \"has it all\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and that, to add insult to injury, it was a Republican woman who had realized this Left-liberal dream\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6No wonder that the Palin effect is one of false liberation: drill, baby, drill!\n\nThen comes the zinger:\n\nWhat this means \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in Hegelese \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the class struggle encounters itself in its oppositional determination (gegens\u00c3\u00a4tzliche Bestimmung), in its distorted/displaced form, as one among many social struggles.\u00c2\u00a0 And, in exactly the same way, \"anti-elitist\" populism in architecture is the mode of appearance of its opposite, of class differences.\n\nI thought this contrast was better than any review of the book I could\u00c2\u00a0write.\u00c2\u00a0 The author, by the way, makes a contrarian argument that the Khmer Rouge didn't go \"far enough\" (too weak a constructive plan), is joking some of the time, believes that capitalism is doomed, and apparently is still a communist though he refuses to tell us why he has a better alternative than communism as we have known it.\u00c2\u00a0 His book is entertaining, but he ought to just become a social democrat and do mass transit studies for the Aarhus municipal government.\n", "title": "Slavoj

I am tempted to comment further on this creative line of reasoning but that is unnecessary since Paul has misunderstood the facts of the matter.\nThe Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), which is the law that caps liability for economic damages at $75 million, does not override state law or common law remedies in tort (click on the link and search for common law or see here).\u00c2\u00a0 Thus, Milton Friedman's preferred remedy for corporate negligence, tort law, continues to operate and there is no doubt that BPs potential liability under common law alone would be in the billions of dollars.\u00c2\u00a0 \nThus, Paul now has only (N-1) reasons why libertarianism doesn't work.\nMoreover, Paul has actually been too unkind to government, a defect it falls upon me (!) to correct. \u00c2\u00a0The point of the OPA was not to limit tort law but to supplement it.\nTort law, as traditionally understood, could only be used to recover damages to people and property rather than force firms to pay cleanup costs per se. \u00c2\u00a0Thus, in the OPA as I read it\u00e2\u20ac\u201cand take the details with a grain of salt since I'm not a lawyer\u00e2\u20ac\u201cthere is no limit on cleanup costs. \u00c2\u00a0Moreover,\u00c2\u00a0the OPA makes the offender\u00c2\u00a0strictly liable for cleanup costs\u00c2\u00a0which means that if these costs are proven the offender must pay them regardless (there are a few defenses, such as an act of war, but they are unlikely to apply).\u00c2\u00a0 The offender is also strictly liable for up to $75 million in economic damages above and beyond cleanup costs.\u00c2\u00a0 Thus the $75 million is simply a cap on the strictly liable damages, the damages that if proven BP has to pay regardless.\u00c2\u00a0 But there is no limit, even under the OPA, on economic damages in the event that BP failed to follow regulations or is otherwise shown to be negligent (same as under common law).\u00c2\u00a0\n", "title": "Oil Spills, Tort Law and Libertarianism"}, {"index": 778, "text": "\nTurkey can afford to keep tax rates unchanged \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for the foreseeable future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while other European governments struggle to repair the damage done by the financial crisis, Ali Babacan, economy minister, said on Wednesday.\nHis comments reflect Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pride in weathering last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil without bailing out any banks or seeking help from the International Monetary Fund.

I find that poll taxes and literacy tests each lowered overall electoral turnout by 10-23% and increased the Democratic vote share in national elections by 5%-10%. Second, employing newly collected data on schooling inputs, I show that disenfranchisement reduced the teacher-child and teacher-student ratio in black schools. Finally, I develop a model of suffrage restriction and redistribution in a 2-factor economy with occupational choice to generate sufficient statistics for welfare analysis of the incidence of black disenfranchisement. Consistent with the model, disenfranchised counties experienced a 7% increase in land and farm values per decade, despite a 4% fall in the black population share.

The index places Greece at No. 109, just behind Egypt, Ethiopia and Lebanon. For the category of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high-income countries,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Greek ranking is next to last, ahead of only Equatorial Guinea, which has oil wealth. \nGreece has a malfunctioning fiscal system in which the shadow economy is estimated to be roughly 20 to 30 percent of the reported economy and tax evasion may run at $30 billion a year. Simply collecting taxes that are legally due would help bring Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s books into balance, yet even this simple remedy does not appear imminent. \nAs the World Bank index suggests, government funds are often spent hindering production rather than supporting it. This gives one clue as to why the numbers make Greece appear richer than it really is. Public expenditures are valued at cost when measuring gross domestic product, yet arguably the quality of Greek public services, per dollar spent, is less than that of many wealthy countries. Nonetheless Greece plunged ahead and joined the euro\u00c2\u00a0zone in 2001, with some unfortunate consequences. \n\nA few scattered points which did not make it into the column:\n1.

Consider the environmental issue: in reality, the perpetrators of oil spills never pay most of the cost; but in reality, environmental regulation has led to much cleaner air and water. (Look up the history of Los Angeles smog or the fate of Lake Erie if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe me.)\nSo why does regulation work? If polluters can buy off the system ex post, after a disaster, why don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they manage to totally corrupt regulation ex ante? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot to say about that, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a literature I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read. But one thing we tend to forget in this age of Reagan is the importance and virtues of a dedicated bureaucracy: when you have professional government agencies with a job to do, and treat them with respect, that job often gets done.\n\nI'll offer a few points:\n1. Here is Susan Rose-Ackerman on regulation vs tort\u00c2\u00a0(JSTOR).\u00c2\u00a0 This is a standard piece in the area, and although she does not stress public choice arguments, the upshot\u00c2\u00a0is not extremely\u00c2\u00a0far from Krugman's conclusions.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0She thinks that tort can replace regulation to only a limited degree.\n2.\u00c2\u00a0I agree with Krugman that the \"tort only\" position espoused by some libertarians does not work.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet I do not think his remarks are pointing at the best possible understanding of the question.\u00c2\u00a0 For instance\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n3.\u00c2\u00a0There is in fact an agency regulating off-shore drilling and in the case under question it totally failed.\u00c2\u00a0 How can Lake Erie, an orthogonally related success,\u00c2\u00a0be cited but\u00c2\u00a0this very directly relevant failure\u00c2\u00a0not be mentioned?\u00c2\u00a0 \nFurthermore\u00c2\u00a0standard accounts of this failure blame regulatory capture, and the Congressional desire for revenue for this failure, not the ideology of free market economics.\u00c2\u00a0 You might also blame voter sentiment, since Obama seemed to pick up some advocacy of off-shore drilling from the Republicans and arguably this happened because that position proved to be one of the few effective Republican arguments in the last election.\u00c2\u00a0 \n4. There are plenty of problems where tort works better than regulation, most notably when behavior cannot be controlled or measured easily ex ante or where the correct decision relies on the producer's decentralized information.\u00c2\u00a0 This encompasses numerous areas, from\u00c2\u00a0medical practices to accident law to injuries resulting from the handling of guns to, most of all,\u00c2\u00a0many micro-components of highly regulated sectors.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Here is a legal and moral defense of tort law.\n5. Off-shore drilling is closely related to these cases.\u00c2\u00a0 For a number of obvious reasons, it is hard for the regulator to monitor how safe an off-shore platform really is.\u00c2\u00a0 We thus rely\u00c2\u00a0a lot on ex post penalties in this area (regulatory as well as tort), not because of ideology but because the ex ante proscriptions don't have as much bite as we would like.\u00c2\u00a0 This reliance on the ex post penalty also means that \"regulation plus tort\" (never mind \"regulation alone\" or \"tort alone\") may not work so well in this area, with or without free market ideology.\n6. Krugman seems to argue that regulators are more protected from the ravages of bad ideology than are judges.\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe yes, maybe no (see below), but such a comparative argument is\u00c2\u00a0unnecessary.\u00c2\u00a0 The\u00c2\u00a0most salient\u00c2\u00a0point\u00c2\u00a0for Krugman's conclusion is simply that optimality requires a bit of regulation and a bit of tort law and that to do without regulation is, in some regards, to be too lax.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0He could justify his main conclusion much more simply than he does.\u00c2\u00a0 (That said, I still believe in\u00c2\u00a0less regulation than Krugman does, though I accept the logic of this argument.)\n7. If we need to make the said comparison \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0the corruptibility of regulation vs. the corruptibility of tort law \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0an independent judiciary need not do worse than a respected bureaucracy and indeed the former is arguably more protected from political interference.\u00c2\u00a0 It's also the case that the judiciary is more likely to overturn very bad behavior from other parts of the government.\u00c2\u00a0 This is an advantage for judicial approaches over reguatory approaches and it is a further sign of (partial) judicial independence.\n8.\u00c2\u00a0I worry when\u00c2\u00a0numerous bloggers and writers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d not just Krugman \u00e2\u20ac\u201d hold a\u00c2\u00a0primary theory of regulatory failure based on\u00c2\u00a0regulators who do not agree with them ideologically.\u00c2\u00a0 This is\u00c2\u00a0at odds with a big chunk of the relevant\u00c2\u00a0public choice literature, which stresses knowledge and incentives, yet without ruling out ideological bias as a factor.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Political science approaches to regulation offer greater scope for ideological bias as a major cause of regulatory failure, but still\u00c2\u00a0it is hardly the dominant theory to the exclusion of others.\u00c2\u00a0 In this matter we should follow the literature, and evidence, which are there for the taking.\n", "title": "Regulation vs. tort"}, {"index": 817, "text": "Here is one piece of evidence which says no.\u00c2\u00a0 The bottom line seems to be that large banks are better at mobilizing capital internationally:\n\nAn essential step to see if this view has ground is analysing how multinational banks have been faring in the months of the crisis, in comparison to domestic banks. Given the key role of these multinational banks in supporting the real economy, whether their subsidiaries in host countries have been restraining the amount of resources provided to local residents during the recession.\nIn a recent paper prepared for the Economic Policy panel in Madrid (Barba Navaretti et al. 2010), we provide both aggregate and micro evidence that multinational banks have actually contributed to the stabilisation of financial markets in Europe and to the provision of credit to the real economy (notwithstanding the systemic nature of the crisis).\nThe aggregate banking statistics of the Bank for International Settlements show that the total local claims held by the affiliates (branches and subsidiaries) of multinational banks in host countries in Europe have been stable and even increasing between the beginning of 2007 and the third term of 2009, both in absolute terms and normalised by GDP or total financial activities (Figure 1 for total local claims in local currency). Claims have been rising also in the major Central and Eastern European Countries where foreign banks account for the dominant share of total banking activities. This pattern is consistent with broader worldwide evidence.\n\nHere is the conclusion:\n\nContrary to popular belief, our results show that a world with only small and domestic banks is no safer. Rather, we show that the size and the global extensions of the activities of multinational banks positively contributed to hedging the downturns of the crisis, even in transition economies.\n\n", "title": "Should the large banks be broken up?"}, {"index": 818, "text": "1.

The court also ordered the city to divide backpay owed among the rest of the black applicants.\n\nWhite, Asian and Hispanic applicants who also scored above 64 but below the 89 standard were not offered employment or backpay.\nPerhaps you are wondering about the tests? \u00c2\u00a0You would be hard pressed to find any obvious racial bias. \u00c2\u00a0I haven't found the Chicago test online but you can find similar tests from New York (also the subject of lawsuits) here. \u00c2\u00a0Here is a sample questions from New York.\n\n\n Nowadays the Chicago fire department simply gives everyone an easy test and then they hire randomly.\n\n", "title": "The 1964 Civil Rights Act in the 21st Century"}, {"index": 821, "text": "Arnold Kling makes some good points:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6after a crash it is very tempting for people to believe that the previous prosperity was false. However, there is a good economic case for presuming that it is a recession that is an aberration, not prosperity. For example, a graph of long-term GDP growth shows a steady upward trend, to which we return even after severe recessions. \nWe still have the capacity to produce the output we produced in 2006. Therefore, to a first approximation, we should still be able to consume what we consumed in 2006. \n\nI have a few responses:\n1. The problem is not in reattaining the 2006 level per se, but rather that people in 2006 expected an entire future path of growth which now appears further away.\u00c2\u00a0 They made plans based on these expectations and we are not yet in a position to make comparably luxurious plans.\u00c2\u00a0 Ireland is an extreme example of this point and do note that their capital stock has not been destroyed.\n2.

The average state experiences a 40 to 50 percent increase in earmark spending if its senator becomes chair of one of the top-three committees. In the House, the average is around 20 percent. For broader measures of spending, such as discretionary state-level federal transfers, the increase from being represented by a powerful senator is around 10 percent.\nQ: Perhaps the most intriguing finding, at least for me, was the degree and consistency to which federal spending at the state level seemed to be connected with a decrease in corporate spending and employment. Did you suspect this was the case when you started the study?\nA: We began by examining how the average firm in a chairman's state was impacted by his ascension.

Lefty economists might generally believe that increasing spending is a more efficient way of stimulating consumption than reducing taxes, but they'd almost certainly accept a big tax cut as an almost-as-good substitute. And tax cuts have two big advantages over spending. On the substantive side, they work faster. Spending takes time to work its way through the economy, but a tax cut (for example, a payroll tax holiday) boosts the economy almost immediately. And on the political side it's quite doable. Republicans would be persuadable because they love tax cuts and Democrats would be persuadable because it would help the economy. For Obama, then, it would be the best of all worlds: a fast stimulus that gets bipartisan support, something that boosts the economy while dampening the inevitable criticism he'd get for blowing up the deficit.\nBut he's not pushing for this. Not even quietly. And this suggests that Tyler is right: Obama's advisors might be in favor of further fiscal stimulus, but not by much.

It's the invisible hand that's calling the shots, as Mr. Simon subtly reminds us in the conclusion to the third season, when Detective McNulty wondrously pulls a book from the shelf of murdered drug dealer Stringer Bell, and the camera focuses in on the title: \"The Wealth of Nations\" by Adam Smith.\n\n\n\tSmith's metaphor of the invisible hand, like Mr. Simon's invocation of Zeus, tells us that to understand the world we need to look beyond the actions of individuals to see the larger forces at work. But Zeus is an arbitrary and capricious god whose lightning bolts fall out of the sky without reason or direction. Smith's \"invisible hand,\" however, is that of a kinder god, a god that cares not one whit for individuals but nevertheless guides self-interest toward the social good, progress, and economic growth. So Mr. Simon understands that the Baltimore dockworkers lost their jobs because of the relentless change that capitalism brings and not through any fault of their own. But Adam Smith sees what Mr. Simon does not, namely that it was capitalism that brought the Baltimore stevedores their high wages in the first place and it is the relentless change of capitalism that slowly raises wages throughout the world. \n\nMore here.\n", "title": "Capitalism: Hollywood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Miscast Villain"}, {"index": 869, "text": "1.

These proposals, offered in the name of consumer protection, seek to constrain the setting of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153interchange fees\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u201c transaction charges integral to payment card systems\u00e2\u20ac\u201cthrough a range of proposed political interventions. This article identifies both the theoretical and actual failings of such regulation. Payment cards are a secure,\u00c2\u00a0 inexpensive, welfare-increasing payment mechanism largely unlike any other in history. Rather than increasing consumer welfare in any meaningful sense, interchange fee legislation represents an attempt by some merchants to shift costs away from their businesses and onto card issuing banks and cardholders. In particular, bank-issued credit cards offer a dramatic improvement in the efficiency and availability of consumer credit by shifting credit risk from merchants onto banks in exchange for the cost of the interchange fee\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccurrently averaging less than 2% of purchase value. Merchants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 efforts to cabin these fees would harm not only consumers but also the merchants themselves as commerce would depend more heavily on less-efficient paperbased payment systems. The consequence of interchange fee legislation, as Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experiment with such regulation demonstrates, would be reduced access to credit, higher interest rates for consumers, and the return of the much-loathed annual fee for credit cards. Interchange fee regulation threatens to constrain credit for consumers and small businesses as the American economy begins to convalesce from a serious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153credit crunch,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and should be accordingly rejected. \n\n", "title": "The economics of interchange fees"}, {"index": 883, "text": "\nChicken noodle soup has been especially vexing, he said.

I had started once a week therapy with a McLean Hospital based psychiatrist named Lenore Boling, and I used the sessions really just to give voice to my unhappiness with what my relationship with Cindy had become. Despite the unhappiness, I do not think I ever shed a tear in those sessions over the shambles of the marriage. One day, however, I started talking about my work. I tried to explain to Dr. Boling that in all of my writing, whether it was on Kant's First Critique or Hume's Treatise or Das Kapital, my goal always was to plumb the depths of the author's central idea and recast it in a form so simple, so clear, so transparent that I could hold it before my students or my readers and show them its beauty. As I said these words, tears started to well up in me, and I finally had to stop talking because I could not finish. It was the only time in twenty years of psychotherapy that I cried openly in a session. Ever since that day, twenty-five years ago, I have understood that it is this intellectual intuition of the transparent beauty of an idea, not the desire for status or recognition or money, that has throughout my life been the driving force behind my writing and teaching. This is why it makes little difference to me whether reviewers agree with what I say, and it is why I am made somewhat uncomfortable by praise. The intrinsic beauty of the idea is the focus of my concern. It seems that I am, after all, more capable of shedding tears for the central argument of the Deduction of the Pure Concepts of Understanding than I am for a failed marriage or even for a deceased parent.

At the same time, the G-5 countries are also home to the largest private creditors in global markets, including the world's largest commercial banks. Consequently, G-5 bank exposure heavily influences these governments' preferences over IMF lending policies. In particular, I find that IMF loan size and conditionality vary widely based on the intensity and heterogeneity of G-5 governments' domestic financial ties to a particular borrower country. When private lenders throughout the G-5 countries are highly exposed to a borrower country, G-5 governments collectively have intense preferences and are more likely to approve larger IMF loans with relatively limited conditionality. In contrast, when G-5 private creditors' exposure to a country is smaller or more unevenly distributed, G-5 governments' interests are weaker and less cohesive, and the Fund approves smaller loans with more extensive conditionality. I find strong evidence that these patterns hold both within countries over time (I focus on IMF lending to Korea and Mexico from 1983-1997 in the book), as well as more systematically over time and across cases for the universe of IMF loans from 1984-2003.\n\nMost of the post concerns what will happen with Spain; can you predict Chinn's answer?\n", "title": "A public choice theory of the IMF"}, {"index": 947, "text": "This post is superb, as\u00c2\u00a0it is very much trying to elevate the level of debate on fiscal stimulus.\u00c2\u00a0 Here is one excerpt:\n\nLying is optimal. The debate among public officials about austerity cannot be taken at face value. Savers really could flee the euro, dollar, yen or yuan. Interest rates here or there could suddenly spike. A sudden dash to gold is possible. None of these financial market events would directly affect the real resources at our disposal, but any of them could devastate our ability to organize economic behavior, and would call into question the legitimacy of economic outcomes and the stability of governments. For policymakers who seek positive short-to-medium term outcomes, the optimal strategy is to avoid the first-order costs of austerity by spending and avoid second-order costs #1 and #5 by obfuscating their spending as much as possible. Costs #2, #3, and #4 tend to bite over the medium-to-long term, leading policymakers to discount them. I think we should expect a lot more austerity theater than actual austerity, for better and for worse. Expect central bankers especially to preach austerity while intervening madly in the shadows. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just what they do. By the same reasoning, we should expect policymakers to justify their actions with a lot of intuitive but awful theory. As the Modern Monetary Theorists remind us, the analogy between a fiat-currency-issuing government and a budget-constrained household is poor. It is, nevertheless, the framework under which most citizens and savers understand government accounts, and forms the basis of conventional discourse. Irrespective of what is a better or worse description of reality, it is safer for policymakers to frame their communication in terms of conventional theory than to promote a profoundly destabilizing paradigm shift.

Even if consumers do save all that money, fiscal stimulus on the spending side still has an impact: useful stuff gets done.\n\nThat's fine,\u00c2\u00a0with the side note that I am more skeptical about\u00c2\u00a0public sector spending.\u00c2\u00a0 I'll push this line of reasoning to the next step, however, and stress we don't need to increase debt at all to have a big and effective stimulus.\u00c2\u00a0 (By the way, accepting this\u00c2\u00a0argument means that a central bank can undo\u00c2\u00a0a decrease in the federal debt, as mentioned\u00c2\u00a0in point one.)\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \nOn\u00c2\u00a0point three, on federalizing Medicaid,\u00c2\u00a0we agree.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Point four is about the value of\u00c2\u00a0worst-case thinking and that means a fiscal crisis can come even when it appears unlikely.\u00c2\u00a0 I wish to heed that risk by doing something other than pledging\u00c2\u00a0our next President and Congress will solve the problem.\nElsewhere, Brad has written:\n\nThe obvious policy is the long-term debt neutral stimulus: spending increases and tax cuts for the next three years, standby tax increases with triggers and spending caps with triggers thereafter, all calculated to guarantee that the debt is no larger ten years from now than in the baseline.\n\nAn alternative\u00c2\u00a0version of this would be:\n\nWe can and should do major stimulus without increasing the debt burden, short-term or long-term.\u00c2\u00a0 Increasing M, through monetary policy, is usually more effective than making periodic attempts to keep V up and running, through fiscal policy.\u00c2\u00a0 Plus it is often easier to turn monetary rather than fiscal policy\u00c2\u00a0on a dime, especially in a democracy and for Brad I can cite the risk of a Republican administration.\u00c2\u00a0 Talk of the zero bound doesn't matter much for the policies we should choose, namely money-financed, non-exotic\u00c2\u00a0direct stimulus.\n\nWhy is it necessary to take on or intellectually defend higher debt levels?\u00c2\u00a0 Short-term debt can too easily become a long-term commitment.\u00c2\u00a0 Why is it necessary to discuss the zero bound so much?\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0In my view of this exchange, Brad and I largely agree, but he does not (yet?) agree that we largely agree.\u00c2\u00a0 I want to see him criticize debt finance more than he seems willing to do.\nI believe the \"zero bound\" is perhaps the single largest \"red herring\" in the economics profession today.\nAddendum: Arnold Kling comments.\u00c2\u00a0 And Brad DeLong responds in the comments section.\n", "title": "Response from Brad DeLong on fiscal policy"}, {"index": 957, "text": "\nA\u00c2\u00a0bill (note: linked site is written in Hebrew) submitted to Israel's parliament, the Knesset, by lawmaker Rachel Adatto \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a doctor who devoted much of her career to women's health issues \u00e2\u20ac\u201d pushed for\u00c2\u00a0legislation to keep underweight models out of commercials;

Seek out mid-level German restaurants, of the kind promoted in the Time Out Guide;\u00c2\u00a0Renger-Patzsch is a good example.\u00c2\u00a0 The vegetables in such places will be consistently excellent.\n4. The speed and service quality of most meals will be much better if you arrive before 7 p.m.\n5. Don't obsess over German food.\u00c2\u00a0 It's underrated, but still\u00c2\u00a0a lot of it isn't that good.\u00c2\u00a0 In Berlin, and many other parts of Germany, you have first-class delicatessens or stores with foodstuffs from France, Italy, and many other parts of the world.\u00c2\u00a0 Use them.\u00c2\u00a0 Berlin offers one of the best overall selections in this regard, better than\u00c2\u00a0New York City or Paris, for instance, in terms of real access.\u00c2\u00a0 You can eat\u00c2\u00a0first-rate French cheese every day.\n6. When it comes to Berlin German food, don't eat anything in a sauce.\u00c2\u00a0 It will be either boring or disgusting.\u00c2\u00a0 Sorry.\n7. The sausage spread at the KaDeWe (make sure you live near that place) is probably the best in the entire world.\u00c2\u00a0 Go there regularly.\u00c2\u00a0 They also have first-rate sausages from France, Spain, and other countries, as well as an unparalleled selection of sausages from the different regions of Germany, organized one region per case.\u00c2\u00a0 This food source, like #1, insures that each of your food days will be a splendid one.\n8. Go to Berlin's numerous and varied ethnic restaurants, especially in the slightly lower rent districts.\u00c2\u00a0 If the food is supposed to be spicy, you must repeat the following incantation several times: \"Ich will es essen, genau wie Sie es zu Hause essen.\u00c2\u00a0 Ich bin kein deutscher.\"\u00c2\u00a0 [I want\u00c2\u00a0to eat it exactly as you eat it at home.\u00c2\u00a0 I am not a German.\"]\u00c2\u00a0 Repeat especially that last part: \"Ich bin kein deutscher.\"\u00c2\u00a0 Repeat it even if you are a German.\u00c2\u00a0 This will usually work and typically your Chinese or Thai or Indian server will smile and laugh\u00c2\u00a0in response.\u00c2\u00a0 If they view you as a German, you are screwed no matter what.\u00c2\u00a0 Simply asking for the food to be \"spicy\" or even \"very spicy\" is laughable.\u00c2\u00a0 It is showing yourself to be a fool and a sucker.\n9.\u00c2\u00a0Food here is much cheaper than in Paris, and it is much easier to get into virtually any restaurant.\u00c2\u00a0 Take advantage of both features.\n10. Italian food here is almost always reasonably good, and reasonably cheap, but it is rarely great.\u00c2\u00a0 Lots of cream sauces.\u00c2\u00a0 It's a good enough fall back and you find it virtually everywhere.\u00c2\u00a0 A quite good pasta for $6 or even less is a common experience.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes it's actually German food in disguise, or not in disguise, such as when you get Carpaccio with Pfifferlinge.\n11. For ethnic food, I recommend\u00c2\u00a0the following: Tian Fu in Wilmersdorf (very good Sichuan), Suriya-Kanthi (Sri Lankan in Prenzlauer Berg),\u00c2\u00a0Genazvale (Georgian food in Charlottenburg), Degirman is one good Turkish place of many, a slew of authentic Mexican restaurants\u00c2\u00a0(more than in Virginia), DAO restaurant in Charlottenburg (Thai food, best papaya salad I've had, all-around excellent), and Schneeweiss has first-rate\u00c2\u00a0Wiener Schnitzel.\nOverall Sri Lankan and Nepalese and East bloc cuisines are\u00c2\u00a0better here, or more available, than in the USA.\nIf you visit for one day, you won't be so impressed with culinary life in Berlin.\u00c2\u00a0 If you stay for a month, you won't want to go back to what you had before.\n", "title": "How to eat well in Berlin"}, {"index": 984, "text": "Here is one good bit of many:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bear living in this huge beautiful world,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mitchell said, gesturing to the rolling green hills and the glittering calm sea, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and not try to imitate it as best I can.

XII\u00c2\u00a0 OF THE PRIDE AND HUMILITY OF ANIMALS \nIt is plain, that almost in every species of creatures, but especially of the nobler kind, there are many evident marks of pride and humility. The very port and gait of a swan, or turkey, or peacock show the high idea he has entertained of himself, and his contempt of all others. This is the more remarkable, that in the two last species of animals, the pride always attends the beauty, and is discovered in the male only. The vanity and emulation of nightingales in singing have been commonly remarked; as likewise that of horses in swiftness, of hounds in sagacity and smell, of the bull and cock in strength, and of every other animal in his particular excellency. Add to this, that every species of creatures, which approach so often to man, as to familiarize themselves with him, show an evident pride in his approbation, and are pleased with his praises and caresses, independent of every other consideration. Nor are they the caresses of every one without distinction, which give them this vanity, but those principally of the persons they know and love; in the same manner as that passion is excited in mankind.

still it might be a good reform.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Another option is for public institutions to adopt different norms for their web writers.\u00c2\u00a0 There are already different norms to some extent (web writings receive less editing, for instance), but it is hard to spread the different norm for the writing to become a different norm for the writer.\u00c2\u00a0 Web traffic is already massive for newspapers, and most readers probably do not distinguish between different kinds of paper employees, such as web vs. non-web.\u00c2\u00a0 Anyway, it's a fuzzy line if a writer has both web and non-web output.\nA more radical change would move away from the manufactured image of\u00c2\u00a0the objective newspaper, but this is\u00c2\u00a0especially difficult\u00c2\u00a0for the Post, given that it relies on both conservative and liberal sources for its key political coverage.\nOverall, we need more incentive-compatible, generalizable\u00c2\u00a0organizational reforms which will allow mainstream\u00c2\u00a0institutions\u00c2\u00a0to have more flexible relationships, and indeed sometimes more distanced relationships,\u00c2\u00a0with their writers.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet reputational forces are often quite blunt, and grossly calculated, and mainstream institutions are\u00c2\u00a0not very far along on making such reforms work.\n", "title": "The Dave Weigel resignation"}, {"index": 988, "text": "1.

The tragedies of 2008 were represented by Bear Stearns\u00c2\u00a0and Lehman Brothers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both private-sector institutions. In 2010, the financial crisis has spread to sovereign debt, with Greece as the most obvious example. \nAll of these developments are part of one broader story of overreach and complacency. Yet the 2008 crises were attached more directly to market institutions, while the 2010 crises are more closely linked to governments. Because politicians and voters are more influenced by the latest developments than by news from two or three years earlier, a cautious attitude toward public-sector spending has been further cemented. \n\nAnd this:\n\nDemocracies, like markets, have some self-correcting mechanisms, and we are now seeing those at work in the United States and many European countries. (Spain and Britain, for example, are pursuing fiscal austerity aggressively.) \nThe lessons are straightforward. First, to paraphrase the French moralist La Rochefoucauld, things are never as good, or as bad, as they seem. Second, the Obama reforms, like the Reagan revolution, are turning out to be radically incomplete, which should come as no surprise. \nFinally, effective political ideas are those that can still do good in half-baked form. We have neglected this insight in designing financial reform, and it remains to be seen if we can apply it successfully to climate change. \n\nOverall, I believe we are headed toward slower growth and a larger public sector, but I do not believe we are headed down the road to serfdom.\u00c2\u00a0 At the same time, I am aiming at a different target.\u00c2\u00a0 Critics of incrementalism are usually too focused on the single issue at hand \u00e2\u20ac\u201d where they are sure they know best \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and not sufficiently aware of the efficiency properties of the broader system, which introduces self-correction mechanisms to counter or limit most major changes.\nIf I had to stress one sentence from the piece, it would be this one:\n\nFinally, effective political ideas are those that can still do good in half-baked form.\n\n", "title": "The Road to Medicare, not The Road to Serfdom"}, {"index": 991, "text": "1.

Rather, it innovated, creating a system based on the English Common Law, yet different, one with explicit checks and balances to restrain government, and with no place for a monarch. It was an experiment with a more radical form of democracy than existed anywhere in the 18th-century world.\n\n\n\tAnd it was an incredibly successful experiment, as the combination of that innovative rule-set and the empty frontier resulted in America growing rapidly in population, wealth, and influence. During the open immigration periods of the 19th century, some years saw over a million new immigrants arrive \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yearning to breathe free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As a result, the new American state had influence far beyond its shores.\n\n\n\tThis influence occured in two major ways. First, America served as a test of the brand-new American Constitution, and the Founding Fathers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 philosophy about the role of government. By showing that it worked well in practice, political philosophers, politicians, voters, and revolutionaries around the world were (slowly) convinced that this was the best government technology to be had. Second, America dramatically outcompeted existing states, based on the simple metric of net migration. Those million+ people a year who went to America can be thought of as customers of government services voting with their feet, which means that other countries were losing market share.\n\n\n\tYou may not be used to thinking of government in this sort of economic and business framework, but it is a core part of our philosophy here at Let A Thousand Nations Bloom, and we find it provides a unique and refreshing angle on government.
