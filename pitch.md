Really interesting, exists at an intersection, i want to build up to why it is what it is

## The Cloud

To start lets look at the trend in software for running companies.

ERP systems of the 90s
Perforce 90s
Jira 2002
Basecamp 2004
MS Team Foundation server 2005

Later chat becomes more prominent:

Skype 2003
Hipchat 2010
Slack 2013

Modern migrate essentially to:

* Salesforce
* Workday
* Gmail / Gsuite
* Github
* Asana / Atlassian - Jira / Confluence / Trello
* Slack / Intercom
* Dropbox / Gdrive

This is essentially your "modern stack" for a company. Important part is this is much bigger and less unified on average than before. You don't use a big suite anymore.

You have chat coming to prominence and used everywhere, but everyone agrees now its causing headaches. Theres whole memes about notification noise. Every HN thread is full of complaints. Tons of medium articles, viral tweets about it. It's huge amount of noise on top of an already fragmented picture.

Big companies are taking notice:

* Dropbox P1
* Atlassian Trello "unified notifications"
* Microsoft 365
* GSuite and old Google for Work (why did they kill it?)

## Machine Learning

The trends in ML are phenomenal. Huge advances in NLP every couple months the last years. From 75% to 95% accuracy across the 7 biggest tests in the last 4 years.

It's faster, smarter, with bigger corpus datasets to use. We can actually summarize well, we can document similarity quickly and effectively.

So can ML solve our problems of organizing the cloud for us?

Maybe. Technically it probably can but the hard part isn't really the ML, it's _how_ do you bring cohesion to company operations and is that really valuable.

## Desktops

Meanwhile desktops have stagnated. Spotlight? Notification drawer? Nothing integrates with the cloud. ML is used only in the most limited areas -- we can ask Siri for very specific things.

"Our computers dont feel like Minority Report"

## All together now

We figured out one big key thing: you have to solve this on your desktop. And you can do it because:

* Software has gotten good enough: node/electron/react/new state management systems/ecosystem is huge.

  * Means: The bar is higher for software, but the tools are better, so the "work" to realize an ambitious idea is still very high, but the result is much cooler.
  * Means: this startup better sound like its hard

* Machine learning is getting good enough: we can do on-device document similarity and summarization at truly impressive speed and accuracy.

* The cloud has gotten diverse and noisy enough (self evident)

* Intranet systems are out of date. Wikis suck. Nothing organizes or shows your company

* Stripe home is the best example of what the future could look like.

* Big insight: The only way you can do it is on-device (privacy/security is impossible otherwise)
