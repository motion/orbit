<IntroText>
  Lists support many common needs, allowing you to focus on building your app. They allow filtering,
  grouping, sorting, searching, virtualization, selection, keyboard navigation and more.
</IntroText>

A `<List />` is the highest level and most powerful list view in the interface kit. It is
virtualized by default, but acts almost entirely like a non-virtualized list.

Lists ultimately will render a `<ListItem />`, though you can change the view it renders with the
`ItemView` property.

It has many features built-in, including:

- Ordering, filtering, searching, and grouping through `useFilter()` props.
- Selections and multi-selections through `useSelection()` props.
- Sortable through the `sortable` prop.
- Shows a title, subtitle, padding, elevation and more through `<Section />` props.
- Sharing to the [Share menu]() through `shareable` prop.
- Keyboard navigation through the `Shortcut` store.
- Sizeable with the `scale` prop.

To use a List:

```tsx
import { List } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples

### Basics

Lists are simple to use. The items are dynamically sized, and most of the elements like icon, title,
subtitle, and children accept any `ReactNode` you'd prefer. You can add extra elements using
`before` and `after`.

<Example willScroll id="Simple" />

Here's some slightly different item props.

<Example willScroll id="SimpleAlt" name="Showing more props" />

### Grouping, sorting, searching

Lists have built in support for grouping, searching, sorting, and filtering. This is important for
building many types of apps, and all of these props must work together.

Grouping works by setting the `separator` prop for each `<ListItem />` automatically.

<Example willScroll id="Grouping" />

Because all text elements are highlightable, searching will automatically highlight the found
phrases. Here we are searching for "st" and sorting them by their email address.

<Example willScroll id="OrderFilter" name="Search + Sort" />

### Selection and shortcuts

Lists support selection the same as tables. That means you can use `selectable` or
`selectable="multi"`. Selection is powerful and has many features you'd expect in native desktop
selections. You can:

- Hold your mouse down after clicking an item, to move your selection down.
- Move your mouse to the edge as you select to automatically scroll the list.

<Example willScroll id="Selection" name="Single Selection" />

Multiple selections are powerful, and add the following shortcuts and useful ways to select:

- Hold <Key>⌘</Key> to select more than one.
- Hold <Key>shift</Key> to select a range.
- Unselect by holding <Key>⌘</Key> and clicking a previously selected item.

<Example willScroll id="MultipleSelection" name="Multiple Selection" />

There are also a few props to enforce certain types of selection. You can force on selection with
`alwaysSelected`, and have a default selection with `defaultSelected`. Callback from selections are
`onSelect`.

To see more complex lists, check out the [Master Detail](/docs/master-detail) template, which shows
onSelect and keyboard navigation.

### Scaling

Scale works for lists.

<Example willScroll id="Scaling" name="Scale" />

### Using as a section

Orbit aims to make building apps easy, so many of the high level views are wrapped in a
`<Section />`. List is no exception. This lets you quickly and easily show a list, elevate it, add a
title and subtitle, and make it collapsable.

<Example willScroll id="Section" name="Using as Section" />
