<IntroText>
  The UI Kit gives you powerful primitives for building many layouts. At a high level, you can use a
  Grid for automatic layouts. The other options are using a Layout, or manually placing with Stack
  and Stack.

There are three main strategies:

1. Placing all of your items in a [GridLayout](/docs/layout-grid).
2. Having a dashboard-style interface with resizable panes using [Layout](/docs/layout).
3. Manually laying out with [grid](/docs/grid), or [row and column](/docs/layout).

Orbit provides components for each of these use cases.

## 1. Smart Grid

If you don't want to mess around with layout, and your app doesn't have strict requirements for how
it should look, we highly recommend using the `<GridLayout />` view in the Orbit Kit.

The Grid view does a few things you. First, it shows content in a nice grid, which responds to your
view size and lets you resize the inner items. It's based on `react-resizable-grid`.

Beyond that, the grid will allow people in your workspace to update it's sizing and configuration
from the frontend, without having to touch code.

A grid will typically look like something like this:

```tsx
import { App } from '@o/kit'
import { Grid, Card } from '@o/ui'

export default () => {
  return (
    <App>
      <Grid>
        <Card title="My Card">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</Card>
        <Card title="My Card">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</Card>
      </Grid>
    </App>
  )
}
```

## 2. Layouts

Apps that need sidebars, bottom sections and content areas will want to use `<Layout />`. Layouts
give you resizing, flexing, and more. They automatically handle borders and state. An example of a
Layout would look like this:

```tsx
import { Layout, Pane, Title } from '@o/ui'

export default () => {
  return (
    <Layout type="row">
      <Pane resizable flex={1.5}>
        <Layout type="column">
          <Pane resizable>
            <Title>Left Pane</Title>
          </Pane>
          <Pane space padding scrollable="x" flexDirection="row">
            <Title>Below Left Pane</Title>
          </Pane>
        </Layout>
      </Pane>
      <Pane>
        <Title>Right Pane</Title>
      </Pane>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

## 3. Stack and Grid

For all other uses, you have the amazingly powerful Stack and Grid. These views allow you to use
Flexbox, or CSS-Grid, respectively, but they support common spacing, sizing, padding, and scrolling
props that make it very easy to make beautiful layouts. They handle many common "gotchas" that CSS
would normally throw at you, like having to account for it's odd margin tendencies.

An example a using this would look like:

```tsx
import { Stack, Grid, Card, Button } from '@o/kit'

export default () => {
  return (
    <Stack padding="xl" space="xl">
      <Stack direction="horizontal" space spaceAround>
        <Button>Hello</Button>
        <Button>World</Button>
      </Stack>

      <Grid space="md">
        <Card title="Hello" />
        <Card title="To" />
        <Card title="The" />
        <Card title="World" />
      </Grid>
    </Stack>
  )
}
```
