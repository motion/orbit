<IntroText>
  Welcome to the Orbit user manual. This documentation is designed to help you get building with
  Orbit even if you aren't a programmer. If you are a programmer, that's alright too.

Getting started with Orbit is simple and doesn't require setting up any development environment.
Orbit comes with everything you need.

You may be wondering right about now, _what the hell is Orbit, anyway?_ It sounds like a lot of
trumped up hype to me. If that's the case, we'd recommend starting with our blog post, [What the Hell is Orbit?]().

If you're especially sharp and have already seen through the marketing speak, or just generally
don't mind not understanding things before diving in (that's ok, we do it all the time too), then
we'd have to recommend checking the sidebar for the [Quick Start]() or [Building an app]() tutorials.
