  Welcome to the Orbit user manual. This documentation is designed to help you get building with
  Orbit even if you aren't a programmer. If you are a programmer, that's alright too.

Orbit comes with everything you need.

You may be wondering right about now, what the hell is Orbit, anyway? It sounds like a lot of
trumped up hype to me.
