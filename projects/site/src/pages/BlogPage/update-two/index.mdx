We're introducing Orbit into private beta today after a long development period. I'm excited to
introduce it to you.

Orbit is an attempt to build on a vision of a future of computing -- one where apps work together
better, where data is under our control, and where we can in the future augment ourselves with a
knowledgebase that spans everything we do.

Orbit learns a lot from the past, and looks to move computing towards a better future. We'd love it
if you [signed up for our insider list](#end) to receive updates on development and early access.

## A brief history of operation

An in depth, bloody accounting of every decision and development over the last few months.
