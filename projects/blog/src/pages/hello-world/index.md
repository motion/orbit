It's about time! I'm really excited to start talking about Orbit. It's certainly been an intense few years of development, and it feels really great to reach the point where I can start to speak more about it.

I'll start with the most exciting part. We have [our first alpha build]() ready to download. Give it a try. While some of the most interesting parts are barely working, we have pushed hard to get it to where everything we want to do over the next year is roughly in place, auto updates, and looks and feels close to what we want.

Let's start with the mission:

> To create a new [aggregation platform]() for your information that shifts power back to the user -- with much more powerful apps and triggers that are easier to build and deploy.

#### Orbit, The Product

> Orbit is a complement to the Browser and OS: a better app platform that lives on top of your current OS giving it powerful new abilities like Context, People and Language.

Or,

> Where is the Minority Report interface for exploring information!?

- Your OS now syncs items from the cloud into a _Bit_ (get it?)
- In a Spotlight-like drawer, you have instant, on-device NLP powered search
- A novel, state of the art OCR engine powers low-power realtime contextual search to show relevant items as you normally work!

But those are just the building blocks. Our goal is to expose those building blocks to everyone so they can sync new data in, use our topic modeling and powerful on-device search, use our state of the art UI Kit and other tooling to quickly build apps, and put it all together into an App Store.

We used to exclusively edit _Files_, now we work mostly in the _Cloud_. But Browsers miss on some of what Operating Systems got right: Controllable, private, searchable, extensible and easily use across many apps.

In the cloud your data is siloed, remote, uncontrolled, slower, and distributed across N incoherent interfaces.

We used to exclusively have _Files_ on our OS. Orbit turns pieces of cloud information into _Bits_. From there we are just putting together a beautiful experience for managing all your knowledge in one place, letting explore, extend and control it.

#### How we got here

About two years ago we pivoted. We had wasted too much time chasing problems that weren't in our expertise. We wanted to build something that solved real problems for a more consumer/end-user demographic.

So in the proceeding months we hypothesized, interviewed, debated, prototyped, and eventually landed on the following problems:

1. Day-to-day information is getting more noisy, disparate, and hard to explore/find.
2. Intranet systems and Wiki's go stale / require too much upkeep to stay relevant.
3. It's hard to understand who is good at what within companies.
4. Internal apps are a pain: from build to deploying to maintenace.

#### How we save the internet

In fact one of the coolest things I can imagine Orbit ending up is by releasing a home server that manages all your personal data privately. I'm calling dibs on the name Ora for that, by the way.
