It's about time! I'm really excited to start talking about Orbit. It's certainly been an intense few years building of development but I it's reached the point now where it presents a pretty solution to a number of important problems.

I'm also very proud to say we have [our first alpha build]() for download. While it's missing some of the most interesting parts, we've pushed hard to get it to where it can plausibly improve your life today.

So, what is Orbit?

Let's start with the mission:

> To take back the web as we know it now by giving end-users decentralized control over their data and interface for that data.

To achieve that, we describe Orbit as:

> An upgrade for your Operating System that integrates all your interesting information into a searchable, explorable, extensible, and (most importantly) beautiful and smart platform.

I like to think of it a merger of the worlds of _Browser_ and _Operating System_. We used to exclusively edit _Files_, now we work mostly in the _Cloud_.

Where browsers don't deliver on their promise is where operating systems get it right: Fast, unified, searchable, extensible, and privacy-controlled. In the cloud your data is siloed, remote, uncontrolled, slower, and distributed across N incoherent interfaces.

We want you to have a beautiful experience for managing all your knowledge in one place, letting you extend and control it. Orbit is re-thinking the Operating System in the world of today: where a "Bit" of information replaces yesterdays "File" (Get it? Or*bit*).

#### How we got here

About two years ago we pivoted. We had wasted too much time chasing problems that weren't in our expertise. We wanted to build something that solved real problems for a more consumer/end-user demographic.

So in the proceeding months we hypothesized, interviewed, debated, prototyped, and eventually landed on the following problems:

1. Knowledge and information is increasingly siloed and out of our control.
2. As we rely more and more on cloud-based services, our ability to interpret, explore, search and extend information in any unified way has disappeared.
3. Intranet systems and Wiki's are almost by definition chronically out of date.
4. Internal app development in general is a pain in the ass: from environemtn, to build, libraries, UI kit, making it interactive, frontend is a huge pain. And that doesn't include infrastructure: spinning up servers, managing keys, pushing updates... it's all painful.

#### How we save the internet

In fact one of the coolest things I can imagine Orbit ending up is by releasing a home server that manages all your personal data privately. I'm calling dibs on the name Ora for that, by the way.
