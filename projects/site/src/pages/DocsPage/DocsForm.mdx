The `<Form />` element lets you create forms. You can either directly pass it children for more
control, or you can create simple forms very easily with a simple object syntax. Further, you can
create forms using a hook and pass that into the form element, which lets you grab data from your
forms as a parent element.

To use a Form:

```tsx
import { Form } from '@o/ui'
```
