title: Zooming on editor should be on GPU
author: Nick Cammarata
integration: github
type: issue
text: Currently the editor is loaded on the CPU, which makes sense. However, we should be able to put zoom on the GPU using linear transforms. Evan has done this already in a limited test case, but we havenâ€™t shipped it into the product yet. We should be able to do this in Figma 2.1.0, and we may want to consider adding it to the list of deliverables.
queries:
  - editor zoom
  - zoom speed
