A `<Button />` is a simple extension of a Surface, as you can see from it's source code at the
bottom of the page. To learn about all the props Surfaces accept, check out the `<Surface />` docs.

To use a Button:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@o/ui'
```

## Examples

### Basics

<Example id="Basic" />

### Coats

See `Coats` for a full list of alternate states, how you can define them in themes, as well as
element which accept them.

<Example id="Coats" />

### MenuButton

For cases where you need a simple dropdown menu, `<MenuButton />` combines `<Menu />` and
`<Button />`.

<Example id="MenuButtonExample" />

### Sizing (Preset)

See our `Sizing` page to read more on the pre-defined size props and which elements accept them.

<Example id="Sizing" />

### Grouping

Using a `<Stack />` with the group prop allows for grouping, which will join together inner elements
and properly handle joining the inner border radius and removing the intermediary borders. You may
also group items using `<SegmentedRow />` to avoid wrapping them in an element.

<Example id="Group" />

### Elevation + Sizing (Absolute)

Elevation is a standardized shadow amount on any button. Shown here, it scales well with size.

<Example id="Elevation" />

### Passing Multiple Props

Using `<SurfacePassProps />` you are able to attach props to the next level of surfaces. While
typically it's recommended to use inheritance and create your own custom Button component, this adds
more flexibility.

<Example id="PassMultipleProps" name="Passing props to multiple" />

### Sizing Props

Because Button extends `<SizedSurface />`, you get complete control over it's various sizable
properties.

<Example id="SizingProps" />
