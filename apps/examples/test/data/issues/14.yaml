title: Performance for multiple images stack on top of each other

type: issue
text: If you have two images on top of each other in the editor right now, it slows the CPU by quite a lot. This might have something to do with the shaders weâ€™re using in WebGL. We can easily fix this by using multiple canvases, but there might be a more elegant solution here.
