  Layouts are great tools for putting together a powerful interface that needs a sidebar, or other
  "areas" that may need to be able to be resized.

Setting up a Layout involves using the `<Pane />` component in coordination. Layouts can have one of
two directions: `type="row"` or `type="column"`.

To use a Layout:

```tsx
import { Layout } from '@o/ui'
```
