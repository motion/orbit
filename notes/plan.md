# current best plan

This serves as my best attempt at the current best steps forward for Orbit.

Orbit is exploring a unique new idea:

Right now there are two models for enterprise software with different trade offs. They are:

1. Cloud

```
+ easy to onboard / low sales process
- security
- need high trust they will "be good with your data"
```

2. On-prem

```
+ secure
+ can have more control
- high sales process due to high onboard cost
```

We are exploring a new model that has unique constraints:

3. Serverless

This basically means everyone runs client apps on-device, which use a p2p network to sync things.

```
+ secure
+ easy to onboard / low sales process
- less reliable sync
- hard to explain
```

## MicroPayments

With OCR and App State APIs working you would have a perfect micropayment tool.

- Works across any browser
- Actually verifies Active Time Spent without spoofing
- Can integrate with other things

So imagine having a payments API.

Then you'd have a little micropayment platform backend running.

Could have news sites integrate with an API that basically allows them to get paid based on the information as long as Orbit is running their site will show....

## Memory

- As you work it scans things
- Search anything you've read/talked about

## Context

- Contextual apps can highlight words on screen
  - can show any content next to them
- As you work you can hold option to see context to anything
- Uses all your knowledgebase
- Highlight any word/sentence to search

## Apps

- All apps should essentially be ways to stay up to date
- Make current integration apps give you update summaries
- Then add "watch" app, for your watch terms
- Then show custom apps of sorts to teammates
  - One click instant deploy
  - Triggers based on incoming bits
  - Triggers based on what you're doing
- HMR edit an app that realtime syncs to team
