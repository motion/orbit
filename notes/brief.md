## secret

distribution and product: on-device (no cloud)

1.  10x faster development (10x simpler deploy, 0 cost of infra, 0 permissions complexity)
2.  100x easier onboarding (download app and done, no on-prem, no signup)
3.  Perfect data security - 100x easier pitch to individual employees

Allows it to side-load into companies organically. Easy to test as a node user.

Also allows us to go really far with UX and platform-like features which cements us as a high engagement, core feature that people use constantly all day and for a wide variety of tasks. This goes hand-in-hand with replacing intranet systems as they should be flexible and core to everything you do.
