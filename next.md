highest level things required for beta:

  - architecture:
    - need a rough mapping of two versions of the sync services:
      (and an idea of how offical v1 should be, how much work to transition to official, etc)
      - beta/rough version
      - official private nice version
    - need to figure API for pane/app that handles all cases nicely
    - many fixes to miller movements
    - many fixes to search and search speed
    - many fixes for window management/persistance
  - integrations:
      - github
      - google docs
      - jira
      - calendar (google + others?)
  - teams:
    - onboarding process
    - figuring who is who across integrations
    - feeds on a person-basis
  - search:
    - how to do
    - potentially filter by source
    - combine multiple topics into feeds
  - quick actions:
    - jira/github cards w actions
  - orbits:
    - some test of sharing to team orbit

maybe:

  - notifications
    - if we have apps that have feeds, may want notifications
