import { Example } from './Example'

A `<List />` is the highest level and most powerful list view in the interface kit.
It is virtualized by default, but acts almost entirely like a non-virtualized list.
It has many features built-in, including:

- Ordering, filtering, searching, and grouping through `useFilter()` props.
- Selections and multi-selections through `useSelection()` props.
- Sortable through the `sortable` prop.
- Shows a title, subtitle, padding, elevation and more through `<Section />` props.
- Sharing to the [Share menu]() through `shareable` prop.
- Keyboard navigation through the `Shortcut` store.
- Sizeable with the `scale` prop.

To use a List:

```tsx
import { List } from '@o/ui'
```
