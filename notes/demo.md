orbit is a place where apps and data play together.

its a home for you and your team to collaborate,

creating and using custom apps based on react, typescript, graphql, and node.

orbit wants to solve building an intranet for teams:

where you have custom needs, but where apps hare many common patterns:

fetching data from many sources easily, displaying large datasets,

it's especially good for building custom workflows and dashboards,

even if the data you interact with comes from knowledge sources like google docs, slack, or other cloud services.

lets learn by exporing and setting up this new workspace i've created.

to start, we'll install a new app from the app store.

everything in orbit san app, and every orbit app has a searchbar in its header,

so even this search store is an app we can use.

i can see my currently installed, or search for something in the store.
